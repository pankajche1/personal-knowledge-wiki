## Three Types of Export Business Plans

Now you’re ready to get organized and create your own plan. To keep the process manageable, let’s look at three different types of sample template plans, each with distinct advantages for business people with different needs. Pick the one that works best for you, keeping in mind that you can shorten the analysis while keeping the major components of the plan intact.

**Q:** What are the three export business plans?

**Ans:**

1. The back-of-the-napkin export business plan (suitable for born-global entrepreneurs)
2. The traditional-export business plan
3. The Laurel export business plan

### 1. The Back-of-the-Napkin Export Business Plan

**Q:** For what type of people is this plan?

**Ans:** Who are big on ideas and pressed for time and want to get to market fast. 

**Q:** Is this plan good?

**Ans:** While it’s typically short and sweet, it serves a better purpose than having *no export business plan at all*. 

**Q:** What is this plan?

**Ans:** A back-of-the-napkin export business plan can be as simple as explaining what the business does, what you want to do next export-wise, and how you are going to get there (who is going to be on board).

**Q:** Give examples to show how a *back-of-the-napkin* plan looks like?

**Ans:**

1. “We make the absolute-best purple widgets  on the planet.” (widget = a small gadget or mechanical device.)
2. “We will export purple widgets.”
3. “We will export purple widgets to France.”
4. “We will consider making other type widgets, say in red, if a customer in France is large enough to justify the change.”
5. “Suzy, Ted, Mike, and I will work on this initiative.”
6. “We will export, at a minimum, twenty thousand purple widgets within the first year.”
7. “We will not reduce efforts from our domestic business to apply them to the export business.”
8. “We will figure out how much money we need and when we need it.”
9. “We will finance the exports of purple widgets with profits from our domestic business.”
10. “We will find our own customers directly via our Web site, blog, and Facebook.”
11. “We will consult with our banker to provide payment options on all export sales.”
12. “We will have fun in the export journey to success!”


**Q:** What is the first step for creating *back-of-the-napkin* plan?

**Ans:** Add a Web site link to show what the business does and provide an executive summary that includes the founder’s bio and the key team members, and you’re done.

### 2. The Traditional Export Business Plan

**Q**: What is *traditional export business plan*?

**Ans:** It’s important to have a business plan, but you don’t have to reinvent the wheel to create one. One place to visit and bookmark online is the Small Business Administration’s “Export Business Planner” (http://www.sba.gov/exportbusinessplanner). It is a free, customizable tool for small-business owners who are exploring exporting. When you are using the planner, you can refer to Getting Started: Creating an Export Business Plan.

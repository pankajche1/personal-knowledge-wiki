**Q:** What is there in this chapter?   
**Ans:** Corporate, Legal, Financial, and Logistical Considerations

> This is the company of the future. Forget about “outsourcing.” In today’s hyperconnected world, there is no “in” and no “out.” There’s only “good, better and best,” and if you don’t assemble the best team you can from everywhere, your competitor will.

**Q:** What are you missing till now in your business plan? (Pankaj)    
**Ans:** You are not thinking of assembling a good team. You never had this idea.

**Q:** Now that you've set up your business plan. What is the next task?    
**Ans:** It’s time to delve a little deeper into assembling your export company. The next step is tackling the essential details of a sound legal, fiscal, and logistical operation. You’ll be faced with obstacles ranging from expanding your enterprise, protecting your company, and choosing a product name and other intellectual property to opening a bank account in your home country, sourcing financing, and dealing with special tax situations. Not all of these issues will come into play immediately, but you will do well to familiarize yourself with the framework in which you 
will be operating right from the start.

Although the expansion of any business tests us on numerous fronts—from hiring the right people to covering fixed expenses and revenue generation—
expanding internationally through exports performed primarily via the Internet challenges us in a whole new way that could potentially interrupt the viability of a business. When reengineering your business from local to export-ready, you must take into consideration bullet-proofing processes, additional laws governing intellectual property, hiring and firing, contracts, and marketing and financial management, as well as settling international disputes.

Prepping for export success boils down to careful planning (refer back to Chapter 2 on crafting a business plan), being proactive in seizing opportunities, and holding transparent discussions with trusted advisors on where you are headed to ensure every move you make is done with confidence and leads to greater growth and prosperity for your business.

**Q:** What is the Export Dream Team (EBT)?    
**Ans:**

**Line Up Your Export Dream Team**

One of the first things you should do before officially setting up your export business, or if you are an established enterprise and haven’t done so already, is to find yourself a good lawyer, a knowledgeable accountant, savvy banker, and logistics expert, each of whom should specialize in international transactions. They are your export dream team (EDT). 

**Q:** But, the above people are expansive. Can I go without them?    
**Ans:** You may feel that you can’t afford to pay for these professional services, but in truth, you can’t afford to do without them.

**Q:** What are the *fab four*?    
**Ans:** Fab means fabulous or wonderful.

**The Fab Four: Lawyer, Accountant, Banker, Logistics Expert**


A qualified lawyer, well versed in international trade and the Internet, will protect you from those who would take advantage of your inexperience in the global marketplace or from unknowingly perpetrating violations yourself! Any one of the big national law firms, such as Baker & McKenzie; Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom; Foley & Lardner; and Latham & Watkins, will be able to advise you on intellectual property issues, the Internet, mergers, acquisitions, and reorganization. The larger the law firm, the greater the overhead and the higher the hourly rates you will be expected to pay. Be aware of this starting out, and if you can’t afford it, go elsewhere to make your investment more cost effective.

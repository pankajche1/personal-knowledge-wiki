**Q:** What is the purpose of this chapter?    
**Ans:** Building a Web Site and Blog.

**Q:** Give some good quotes telling you why you would build web site etc?    
**Ans:** See:

> Branding demands commitment; commitment to continual re-invention; striking chords with people to stir their emotions; and commitment to imagination. It is easy to be cynical about such things, much harder to be successful.

> —Sir Richard Branson, CEO of Virgin

> If you are good at it, people are going to read it.

> —Seth Godin, best-selling author

> The best damn marketing tool by an order of magnitude I’ve ever had.

> —Tom Peters, the Red Bull of management thinkers

**Q:** Do you have to find the customers?    
**Ans:** Many people believe that the best way to find customers is to look for them. That’s a mistake. In the digital age, customers from around the world should find you. And they can, provided you create a sustainable positive online presence. 

**Q:** How will billions of customers find you?    
**Ans:** The secret to billions of customers finding you is to build a world stage comprising of a Web site and a blog. These tools define who you are as a brand and shape what is yet to come for your export business. I will discuss how to market your business later on, in Chapter 10, but understand this: not having a Web site and a companion blog is like keeping your door shuttered to the world. Think I’m wrong? Take a look.

### In Pursuit of Global Power: Snatching and Grabbing Curious Online Customers

**Q:** Is a Web site alone is sufficient to promote a business?    
**Ans:** Due to the explosive growth of the Internet, a Web site alone is not sufficient to promote a business, at least not if you want the entire planet to find you.

**Q:** What is the extent of people on the planet?    
**Ans:** That planet includes more than 7 billion potential customers — and 2.4 billion of them are online. Who wouldn’t want to sell to more than 2.4 billion people or even a tiny fraction of that? Whether you are a first-timer or an experienced pro, leveraging the web is a must to become globally competitive. 

**Q:** What need you do to achieve a powerful web presence?    
**Ans:** To achieve a powerful web presence, you must use a combination of social tools such as blogs, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Instagram, as well as cultivate a brand presence on mobile apps and other online databases. 

**Q:** What traditional things does the on-line presence replace?    
**Ans:** Someday, your online presence will live on your wrist like a watch and replace everything (brick-and-mortar stores, paper resumes, photo albums, and in-person meetings, to name a few), so you’d better aim to get it right the first time around.

#### Plan a Web Site

**Q:** What are fifteen pointers for developing your Web site?    
**Ans:** While a Web site is but a part of your efforts online, it is still the most important one for e-commerce. First and foremost, your Web site should be inviting and reader friendly. When developing your Web site with exporting in mind, here are fifteen pointers that should make the build-out process a lot easier:
1. *Keep content current, accurate, and relevant*. There is nothing worse than visiting a site and seeing out-of-date content or links that don’t work. It’s a surefire way to lose a visitor. And not just for the moment but perhaps forever. First impressions count. Don’t make the information you present overly complicated or go wild with the graphics.
2. *Go mobile right out of the gate*. According to mobiThinking, in 2011 there were an estimated 6 billion mobile subscriptions, with 4.5 billion of them in the developing world. That is the equivalent of 87 percent of the world population. Make sure your Web site is configured and optimized for mobile use. If you find that most people visit your site from mobile devices, consider developing an app for your business to better serve customers.
3. *Express yourself but don’t give your life story on your Web site*. Your message should be concise — clear, consistent, and with an on-brand conversational voice—and interesting enough for visitors to stay with you and eventually take action. Keep the content focused on your business and
related to the action you’d like your visitors to take.
4. *Maintain your Web site so it not only looks beautiful but works beautifully, too*. Speed matters. Customers seek fast, simple solutions to their challenges. Put yourself in their shoes. When you visit your Web site, are you impressed? Compelled to take action? Motivated to return? If not, go back to the drawing board and improve it until it turns even you on. All Web sites should contain a good layout, information about your company, a company logo, targeted image placement, and other strategies that boost your brand. You want your site to be attractive and useful. If need be, hire a professional designer to take your site to the next level.
5. *Review sites you like, bookmark them, and try to incorporate the best elements of each on your site*. I’ve done this many times for ideas on my own company Web site. I see something I like at another Web site and send the link to my designer to see if she can do something similar but
distinct enough that it does not look like we are stealing or copying information from the other company. If you sell jewelry, what are the most popular jewelry sites and why? Use these ideas as a basis or model for developing your own Web site.

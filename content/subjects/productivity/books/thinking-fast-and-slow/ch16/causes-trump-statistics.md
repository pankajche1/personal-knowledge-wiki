## Introduction

Consider the following scenario and note your intuitive answer to the question.

> A cab was involved in a hit-and-run accident at night.
> Two cab companies, the Green and the Blue, operate in the city.
> You are given the following data:

* 85% of the cabs in the city are Green and 15% are Blue.
* A witness identified the cab as Blue. The court tested the reliability of the witness under the circumstances that existed on the night of the accident and concluded that the witness correctly identified each one of the two colors 80% of the time and failed 20% of the time.

> What is the probability that the cab involved in the accident was Blue rather than Green?

## Causal Stereotypes

Now consider a variation of the same story, in which only the presentation of the base rate has been altered.

> You are given the following data:

- The two companies operate the same number of cabs, but Green cabs are involved in 85% of accidents.
- The information about the witness is as in the previous version.

The two versions of the problem are mathematically indistinguishable, but they are psychologically quite different. People who read the first version do not know how to use the base rate and often ignore it. In contrast, people who see the second version give considerable weight to the base rate, and their average judgment is not too far from the Bayesian solution. Why?

In the first version, the base rate of Blue cabs is a statistical fact about the cabs in the city. A mind that is hungry for causal stories finds nothing to chew on: How does the number of Green and Blue cabs in the city cause this cab driver to hit and run?

> **Notes:**

> 1. The mind is hungry for *causal* stories ('causal' not 'casual'). The minds tends to look for the reason/cause of something. And it makes *conclusion*. But in the first scenario you give only the % of blue and green cabs in the city. It is nothing to do with accidents caused by blue or green cabs.

> 2. Lingo: *causal stereotype*. It is *causal* not *casual*.


In the second version, in contrast, the drivers of Green cabs cause more than 5 times as many accidents as the Blue cabs do. The conclusion is immediate: the Green drivers must be a collection of reckless madmen! You have now formed a stereotype of Green recklessness, which you apply to unknown individual drivers in the company. The stereotype is easily fitted into a causal story, because recklessness is a causally relevant fact about individual cabdrivers. In this version, there are two causal stories that need to be combined or reconciled. The first is the hit and run, which naturally evokes the idea that a reckless Green driver was responsible. The second is the witness’s testimony, which strongly suggests the cab was Blue. The inferences from the two stories about the color of the car are contradictory and approximately cancel each other. The chances for the
two colors are about equal (the Bayesian estimate is 41%, reflecting the fact that the base rate of Green cabs is a little more extreme than the reliability of the witness who reported a Blue cab).

> In the second scenario:
  1. Green cabs cause more than 5 times accidents than blue cabs. So the mind has got now the causal
  2. From the above the mind makes a conclusion immediately: Green cab drivers are madmen. And they do more accidents.
  3. The mind forms a stereotype of Green cab rackless drivers. And the mind applies this stereotype to every driver in green cab company.

  **Q2:** What is *stereotype*?

  
## Two types of base rates

The cab example illustrates two types of base rates. *Statistical base rates* are facts about a population to which a case belongs, but they are not relevant to the individual case. *Causal base rates* change your view of how the individual case came to be. The two types of base-rate information are treated differently:

**Q1:** What two types of base rates are illustrated by the cab example?

**Ans:**
1. statistical base rates
2. causal base rates

**Q.** What are statistical base rates?

**Ans.** These are facts about a population to which a case belongs. These are real probabilities.

**Q.** What is the limitation of statistical base rates?

**Ans.** They are not relevant to the individual case.

**Q.** What are causal base rates?

**Ans.** These rates change your view of how the individual case came to be.

**Q.** How are *statistical base rates* and *causal base rates* treated by people?

**Ans.**
- Statistical base rates are generally underweighted, and sometimes neglected altogether, when specific information about the case at hand is available.
- Causal base rates are treated as information about the individual case and are easily combined with other case-specific information.


## causal version of the cab problem

The causal version of the cab problem had the form of a stereotype:

Green drivers are dangerous. Stereotypes are statements about the group that are (at least tentatively) accepted as facts about every member.

## What are stereotype?

Stereotypes are statements about the group that are (at least tentatively) accepted as facts about every member. Here two examples:

> Most of the graduates of this inner-city school go to college.
> Interest in cycling is widespread in France.

These statements are readily interpreted as setting up a propensity in individual members of the group, and they fit in a causal story. Many graduates of this particular inner-city school are eager and able to go to college, presumably because of some beneficial features of life in that school. There are forces in French culture and social life that cause many Frenchmen to take an interest in cycling. You will be reminded of these facts when you think about the likelihood that a particular graduate of the school will attend college, or when you wonder whether to bring up the Tour de France in a conversation with a Frenchman you just met.

## Stereotypes are generated by System 1

Stereotyping is a bad word in our culture, but in my usage it is neutral. One of the basic characteristics of System 1 is that it represents categories as norms and prototypical exemplars. This is how we think of horses, refrigerators, and New York police officers; we hold in memory a representation of one or more “normal” members of each of these categories. When the categories are social, these representations are called stereotypes. Some stereotypes are perniciously wrong, and hostile stereotyping can have dreadful consequences, but the psychological facts cannot be avoided: stereotypes, both correct and false, are how we think of categories.

## A cognitive flaw: the neglect of base-rate information in the cab problem

You may note the irony. In the context of the cab problem, the 
neglect of base-rate information is a *cognitive flaw*, a failure of Bayesian reasoning, and the reliance on causal base rates is desirable. Stereotyping the Green drivers improves the accuracy of judgment. In other contexts, however, such as hiring or profiling, there is a strong social norm against stereotyping, which is also embedded in the law. This is as it should be. In sensitive social contexts, we do not want to draw possibly erroneous conclusions about the individual from the statistics of the group. We consider it morally desirable for base rates to be treated as statistical facts about the group rather than as presumptive facts about individuals. In other words, we reject causal base rates.

## Social norm against stereotyping

The social norm against stereotyping, including the opposition to profiling, has been highly beneficial in creating a more civilized and more equal society. It is useful to remember, however, that neglecting valid stereotypes inevitably results in suboptimal judgments. Resistance to stereotyping is a laudable moral position, but the simplistic idea that the resistance is costless is wrong. The costs are worth paying to achieve a better society, but denying that the costs exist, while satisfying to the soul and politically correct, is not scientifically defensible. Reliance on the affect heuristic is common in politically charged arguments. The positions we favor have no cost and those we oppose have no benefits. We should be able to do better.

## Introduction

Consider the following scenario and note your intuitive answer to the question.

> A cab was involved in a hit-and-run accident at night.
> Two cab companies, the Green and the Blue, operate in the city.
> You are given the following data:

* 85% of the cabs in the city are Green and 15% are Blue.
* A witness identified the cab as Blue. The court tested the reliability of the witness under the circumstances that existed on the night of the accident and concluded that the witness correctly identified each one of the two colors 80% of the time and failed 20% of the time.

> What is the probability that the cab involved in the accident was Blue rather than Green?

## Causal Stereotypes

Now consider a variation of the same story, in which only the presentation of the base rate has been altered.

> You are given the following data:

- The two companies operate the same number of cabs, but Green cabs are involved in 85% of accidents.
- The information about the witness is as in the previous version.

The two versions of the problem are mathematically indistinguishable, but they are psychologically quite different. People who read the first version do not know how to use the base rate and often ignore it. In contrast, people who see the second version give considerable weight to the base rate, and their average judgment is not too far from the Bayesian solution. Why?

In the first version, the base rate of Blue cabs is a statistical fact about the cabs in the city. A mind that is hungry for causal stories finds nothing to chew on: How does the number of Green and Blue cabs in the city cause this cab driver to hit and run?

> **Notes:**

> 1. The mind is hungry for *causal* stories ('causal' not 'casual'). The minds tends to look for the reason/cause of something. And it makes *conclusion*. But in the first scenario you give only the % of blue and green cabs in the city. It is nothing to do with accidents caused by blue or green cabs.

> 2. Lingo: *causal stereotype*. It is *causal* not *casual*.


In the second version, in contrast, the drivers of Green cabs cause more than 5 times as many accidents as the Blue cabs do. The conclusion is immediate: the Green drivers must be a collection of reckless madmen! You have now formed a stereotype of Green recklessness, which you apply to unknown individual drivers in the company. The stereotype is easily fitted into a causal story, because recklessness is a causally relevant fact about individual cabdrivers. In this version, there are two causal stories that need to be combined or reconciled. The first is the hit and run, which naturally evokes the idea that a reckless Green driver was responsible. The second is the witnessâ€™s testimony, which strongly suggests the cab was Blue. The inferences from the two stories about the color of the car are contradictory and approximately cancel each other. The chances for the
two colors are about equal (the Bayesian estimate is 41%, reflecting the fact that the base rate of Green cabs is a little more extreme than the reliability of the witness who reported a Blue cab).

> In the second scenario:
  1. Green cabs cause more than 5 times accidents than blue cabs. So the mind has got now the causal
  2. From the above the mind makes a conclusion immediately: Green cab drivers are madmen. And they do more accidents.
  3. The mind forms a stereotype of Green cab rackless drivers. And the mind applies this stereotype to every driver in green cab company.
  4. TODO

> **Q1:** What is *causal* story? **Note:** 'causal' not 'casual'.  
  **Q2:** What is *stereotype*?

A few years after my collaboration with Amos began, I convinced some officials in the Israeli Ministry of Education of the need for a curriculum to
teach judgment and decision making in high schools. The team that I assembled to design the curriculum and write a textbook for it included several experienced teachers, some of my psychology students, and Seymour Fox, then dean of the Hebrew Universityâ€™s School of Education, who was an expert in curriculum development.

The writer wanted that high school students should be taught the subject of *judgment and decision making*.

> **Debra:** Twenty-five years old. She feels anxious and inferior in social situations.

In our first session, Debra tells us that she is unhappy with her social life. Ever since college ended, she has had trouble meeting people.

> DEBRA: *I haven't had a date in seven months. I haven't really met anybody who wants to date me.*

> THERAPIST: *Where do you usually meet people?*

> DEBRA: *That's part of the problem. I really hate going to a lot of the places to meet people. I'm really shy. I can't talk to people. I don't expect them to like me.*

It surprises us that Debra feels this way, because we find her very personable. Once again we are reminded that a person is not necessarily the same with us as they are in social situations. People can be infinitely more shy and awkward in a group.

As we explore further, it turns out that Debra avoids most social situations: "They make me too anxious." When she is so anxious, she "can't think of what to say" and says "stupid things." She considers herself unattractive and does not expect men to be sexually attracted to her. (Once again we are surprised, because Debra is quite pretty.)

With tears springing to her eyes, Debra tells us that sometimes she feels "like a failure in adult socializing."

> Adam: *Thirty-five years old. He has problems with loneliness.*

From the beginning we sense a quality of apartness in Adam. He seems to hold himself back, to stay detached. He is less able than Debra to say what is wrong, but his problem, too, is loneliness.

Adam feels *different* from other people. "I don't seem to fit in anywhere," he tells me. He has a few close friends he sees occasionally, but less frequently through the years.

> ADAM: *I am afraid I am going to end up entirely alone. I don't really fit in with the people at work, and my personal life is getting sparser and sparser. I just don't feel like I belong anywhere. I'm always on the outside, looking in.*

Adam is able to connect on an intimate level. In the past he has had intimate relationships with lovers and friends. However, he has stopped meeting people, and, aside from work, is not attached to any organization. Like Debra, he avoids most social and group situations.

THE SOCIAL EXCLUSION QUESTIONNAIRE

**YOUR TOTAL SOCIAL EXCLUSION SCORE:**  _____

Interpreting Your Social Exclusion Score:

10-19 Very low. This lifetrap probably does not apply to you.    
20-29 Fairly low. This lifetrap may only apply occasionally.    
30-39 Moderate. This lifetrap is an issue in your life.    
40-49 High. This is definitely an important lifetrap for you.    
50-60 Very high. This is definitely one of your core lifetraps.

### THE EXPERIENCE OF SOCIAL EXCLUSION

The primary feeling is loneliness. You feel excluded from the rest of the world because you feel either undesirable or different. These are the two types of social exclusion. Of course, they often come mixed together, and you may well have both.

Debra is the first type. She feels inferior in social situations, and consequently experiences a great deal of social anxiety.

> DEBRA: *I was invited to a party last Saturday night, and I dreaded it all week. What is it with me? Other people look forward to a party, but all week I couldn 't get it off my mind. I couldn 't relax. I was always on the verge of tears.*

> THERAPIST: *What were you imagining would happen?*

> DEBRA: *Oh, you know, I would get there and be so nervous, and not know what to say. I would act like a jerk. And everyone would seem better than me, better looking or smarter or more successful, and I'd have nothing to offer.    
And you know, that's exactly what happened. The party was like a nightmare. I couldn't wait to leave, and when I got home, I cried and cried.*

Debra feels excluded because of surface qualities. Something about the way she presents herself does not feel good enough. However, Debra does not have the Defectiveness lifetrap. Once she breaks through, meets people, and begins to get close, she is fine. She is comfortable in intimate relationships, and although she has no boyfriend she has many close friends. Debra's friendships offer her some relief from her feelings of inferiority and loneliness. Social Exclusion is about outward, or external, qualities; Defectiveness is about inner, or internal, qualities.

It may be that you have both Social Exclusion and Defectiveness, with Defectiveness the more core lifetrap. If this is so, things are more difficult for you. You may have no connections at all. Right down the line, you are alone. As difficult as Social Exclusion is, Social Exclusion plus  Defectiveness is much worse.

In a circular way, a prime characteristic that makes Debra feel inferior is her anxiety itself.

> DEBRA: *I know when I walk in that I'm going to be anxious. It's embarrassing to be so anxious. I'm uncomfortable, and I make other people feel uncomfortable. As soon as I get in, I know I'm going to screw up somehow. I'll say the wrong thing or do the wrong thing. I just want to crawl into a hole.*

Debra constantly compares herself to other people. This one is better looking, that one is smarter and more interesting. One large focus of her anxiety is her inability to carry on a conversation. She wants to respond appropriately—to speak freely, smile, laugh, and ask questions. But she is too inhibited to do so.

> DEBRA: *It's so frustrating, because as soon as I know the person, I can carry on normal conversations. But when I meet a stranger, I can't do it. I freeze up.*

> THERAPIST: *It's almost like stage fright.*

This kind of performance anxiety is a fundamental part of your experience. You fear being scrutinized, evaluated, judged negatively. You are obsessed with what other people think of you. Depending upon where your sensitivity lies—your looks, career, status, intelligence, or conversational ability - you fear being exposed as inadequate.

Debra's anxiety makes her socially awkward. Although she has good social skills when she is comfortable, in most social situations she is too nervous to use them. She loses her poise. She becomes shy and withdrawn. It is not that she feels particularly different from other people. It is that she feels socially inept.

In contrast, Adam's problems are not related to social skills. In fact, he can have very good social skills. Adam feels fundamentally different from other people. His primary feeling is one of detachment. He comes across as aloof rather than anxious. He has an aura of being "untouchable."

> ADAM: *It's like I'm alone even when I'm in a crowd. In fact, I feel most alone when I'm in a crowd.*

> THERAPIST: *Your loneliness becomes more glaring.*

Adam experiences his life as though he were walking through a crowd of strangers. There is no place where he belongs.

For most people this feeling of being different is painful. Although some see themselves as better, or feel good about being different, most see it as a source of unhappiness. Most of us want to fit in, and we feel pain, hurt, and loneliness when we do not.

Unlike Debra, who feels rejected in social situations, Adam feels a kind of nothingness, a disconnection. For him, social situations trigger a feeling of isolation.

> THERAPIST: *So if you didn 't really talk to people at the party, what did you do?*

> ADAM: *I just went off into my own little world.*

Adam is not angry at the world for rejecting him. Rather, he just feels like an outsider. He is different. He does not fit in.

Social exclusion has many faces. You may be the person everyone teases or bullies. Or you may be the one who is an outsider—the loner or social outcast. You stay on the sidelines, not quite a member of any club or group. Or you may be someone whose lifetrap is largely invisible. It is hard to spot. You go through the motions of social interchange, but inside you feel alone.

Whatever your type, you are probably prone to a whole range of psychosomatic symptoms. Loneliness is often linked to heart and stomach problems, sleep problems, headaches, and depression.

These are some of the reasons you may have felt undesirable or different as a child:

> The Origins of Social Exclusion

> 1. You felt inferior to other children, because of some observable quality (e.g., looks, height, stuttering). You were teased, rejected, or humiliated by other children.
> 2. Your family was different from neighbors and people around you. 
> 3. You felt different from other children, even within your own family.
> 4. You were passive as a child; you did what was expected, but you never developed strong interests or preferences of your own.

Now you feel you have nothing to offer in a conversation.

One origin is growing up in a family that is different from other people. Your family may have been different in many ways—race, ethnic  background, religion, social status, educational level, material possessions.  Perhaps your family's daily habits were different, their manners and customs. Or perhaps there was a language barrier. Or there may have been mental illness in your family, such as alcoholism or schizophrenia. Your family may have moved from place to place, never staying long enough to form roots, such as with military "brats."

Another origin may have been something about you that may have set you apart, so that you felt different even from the children in your own family. Gifted children sometimes experience this. Their interests are different from other children their age. They enjoy reading or listening to
music more than playing with other children. You also may have had interests that were atypical for your gender, such as a boy who likes to play with dolls, or a girl who likes rougher, boy games. Your sexual identity may have isolated you—gay men and women often have the Social Exclusion lifetrap. Your personality may have been different—shy, emotional, introspective, intellectual, or inhibited. Or you may have developed faster or slower than other children, physically, sexually, or in your level of independence, intelligence, or social skills.

Something about you may have caused you to feel inferior to other children. You may have been teased or humiliated. Patients have told us many reasons they became the targets of such attacks:

> **Sources of Childhood and Adolescent Undesirability**

> **Physical**

> Fat, thin, short, tall, weak, ugly, acne, physical handicap, small breasts, big breasts, late puberty, poor at sports, uncoordinated, not sexy.

> **Mental**

> Slow at school, learning disabilities, bookworm, stuttering, emotional problems.

> **Social**

> Awkward, socially inappropriate, immature, unable to carry on conversations, weird, dull, uncool.

As a result of appearing different or undesirable, other children excluded you from their groups. They would not play with you. They teased and humiliated you. You withdrew into the background to avoid being teased. Whenever you went into a social situation, you felt self-conscious. You stopped trying to make friends in order to avoid rejection. You may have associated with other children who were different, but longed to be part of the in-group. You became increasingly lonely and isolated. You developed solitary interests, such as reading or computer games. You may have developed expertise in non-social arenas to compensate for your feelings of inferiority.

Any and all of these things may have happened to you. Most of them happened to Debra.

> DEBRA: *I was fat as a child. I was disgusting. In the playground other kids made fun of me. They would chase me and try to get me to fall down.
When I got older, none of the boys wanted to go out with me. It wasn't till I lost weight before college that I had my first date.*

Debra's social exclusion involved a lot of shame. Her shame about her weight kept her from wanting to be near other children. She felt that as soon as they saw that shameful part of her, they would exclude her.

To compensate for her lack of social success, Debra excelled at school. In fact, she developed Unrelenting Standards in regard to her school  performance. It is fairly common for children who feel socially undesirable to develop Unrelenting Standards as a compensation. Part of Debra's problem is that she has such high standards for how she must come across in a social situation—how poised, how intelligent, how attractive—that she feels that anything less is going to be unacceptable to other people. She anticipates criticism. This is one reason she feels so anxious.

As we noted above, you may have developed Social Exclusion as part of a more core Defectiveness lifetrap. You had such a global sense of being unlovable in your own family that it naturally transferred to your social life. You were uncomfortable in intimate situations and social situations. Now, whenever you interact with another person, you expect your personal unacceptability to become an issue, and you either feel anxious or avoid the situation. You do not expect to be loved or valued. Your lifetrap is part of a more fundamental sense of being defective.

Adam grew up in an alcoholic household. Both parents drank. He was the oldest son, and took over management of the house. By the age of twelve he was effectively functioning as both father and mother to his four younger brothers and sisters.

> ADAM: *My home life made my life at school seem unreal. Other kids would be worrying about what to wear to a party, or making some team, or who to ask to the prom, and Vd be worrying about paying the monthly bills and keeping us off the street.*

Although Adam acted normal at school, he felt far from normal inside—"I felt like another species of life entirely." He never felt he could bring friends to his house, and became very anxious whenever a friend had contact with either of his parents. He tried to keep his school and home lives separate. His family was like a secret he kept from the other children.

Throughout Adam's childhood, the financial status of the family progressively declined. This made matters worse for Adam. Not only did they move a lot, but they also lived in neighborhoods where they felt they did not fit in.

> ADAM: *My parents always considered us above everyone around us. They acted as though we were really different—as though we still belonged in a fancy house in a fancy neighborhood. In fact they would make it seem like our neighbors were kind of bad to be around, a bad influence, so I was encouraged to be kind of different and to stay away from the other kids.*

Adam's parents made him reluctant to get involved with the people around them.

Sometimes overly critical parents can foster social exclusion. We had one patient whose parents constantly criticized him for social imperfections — the way he looked, the way he talked, the way he carried himself. They led him to feel he was socially inadequate. He became inhibited in social situations. He was afraid of being criticized, and therefore avoided connecting with other people.

Another origin of Social Exclusion is related to the Dependence and Subjugation lifetraps. An important aspect of learning to socialize is developing a sense of ourselves as active and self-directed: we are encouraged by our parents to develop our own unique identity, interests, and preferences. We have a unique personality. This personality provides us with the energy and ideas to carry on conversations with other people.

Some children are either passive by nature or their parents discourage the development of their children's individuality. When your uniqueness is squashed, you do what is expected by other people. You take their lead and become a conventional follower. But you fail to develop ideas, interests, or preferences of your own. When you are in a conversation, you then feel that you have nothing to say. Your passivity makes you feel as if you have nothing of your own to offer other people. Carrying on conversations becomes a burden. You are very comfortable listening, but you cannot initiate a topic. You cannot contribute your own opinions. You do not have suggestions about what to do or where to go. After a while, you may decide to avoid socializing altogether rather than be with others and have nothing to contribute. This pattern, like the other origins we have already discussed, leads you to feel socially anxious and isolated.

### LIFETRAPS IN WORK AND LOVE

These are the ways you maintain your Social Exclusion lifetrap. Social Exclusion Lifetraps.

1. You feel different or inferior to the people around you. You exaggerate differences and minimize similarities. You feel lonely, even when you are with people.
2. At work you are on the periphery. You keep to yourself. You do not get promoted or included in projects because you do not fit in.
3. You are nervous and self-conscious around groups of people. You cannot just relax and be yourself. You worry about doing or saying the wrong thing. You try to plan what to say next. You are very uncomfortable talking to strangers. You feel you have nothing unique to offer other people.
4. Socially, you avoid joining groups or being part of the community. You only spend time with your immediate family or with one or two close friends.
5. You feel embarrassed if people meet your family or know a lot about them. You keep secrets about your family from other people.
6. You pretend to be like other people just to fit in. You do not let most people see the unconventional parts of yourself. You have a secret life or feelings that you believe would lead other people to humiliate you or reject you.
7. You put a lot of emphasis on overcoming your own family's deficiencies: to gain status, have material possessions, sound highly educated, obscure ethnic differences, etc.
8. You have never accepted certain parts of your nature because you believe other people would think less of you for them (e.g., you are shy, intellectual, emotional, too feminine, weak, dependent).
9. You are very self-conscious about your physical appearance. You feel less attractive than other people say you are. You may work inordinately hard to be physically attractive, and are especially sensitive to your physical flaws (e.g., weight, physique, figure, height, complexion, features).
10. You avoid situations where you might seem dumb, slow, or awkward (e.g., going to college, public speaking). 
11. You compare yourself a lot to other people who have the hallmarks of popularity that you lack (e.g., looks, money, athletic ability, success, clothing).
12. You put too much emphasis on compensating for what you feel are your social inadequacies: trying to prove your popularity or social skills, win people over, be part of the right social group, have success in your career, or raise children who are popular.

You may feel a lot of romantic chemistry with many types of people. You may be drawn to people who are the opposite of you—who have the outward signs of belonging that you lack. Depending on what your particular Social Exclusion issues are, you may pursue partners who are good-looking, high status, popular or part of the in-group, comfortable in social situations, or normal and conventional. In this way, you can feel as though you belong.

There are advantages and disadvantages to choosing a sociable partner. It might act as a force that keeps you socializing. Eventually you might learn to feel more comfortable and connected. On the other hand, there is a danger that you might become excessively dependent on such a partner to smooth the way for you in social situations. You may even become more shy than before, and rely totally on your partner to carry on conversations and to conduct social encounters. In this way selecting such a partner can reinforce your view of yourself as socially incompetent.

You might also feel attracted to other outsiders. You might feel a special bond with other socially excluded people. You can bolster one another in feeling different.

> ADAM: *My girlfriend Susan was an outcast also. She was this arty type who always wore black and painted these weird pictures. When we were together, we made fun of everyone else. We felt sorry for everyone else for being so pathetically and boringly normal.*

This kind of partner can comfort you about feeling different and make you value your uniqueness more. Instead of feeling alone and different, you can feel together and different—that you are both better than people who are conventional.

People who feel different often band together in groups: the arty types, the nerds, the punks, the greasers. In unity there is strength. A group of outcasts can often elevate their status and feel quite superior and special. Cult groups display this phenomenon. The members consider themselves as having a secret, which only they possess. This fact puts them above outsiders. They are now the insiders, and the rest of the world are the ones left out.

However, some people with this lifetrap do not even feel part of a significant subculture. You may be alienated from all groups.

> ADAM: *I don't fit in anywhere. I'm athletic, but I'm not a jock. But I'm not an intellectual either. I'm not a bohemian, but I'm not a yuppie. I'm torn between all these worlds, and I don't really identify with any of them.*

Even if you overcome your Social Exclusion in adulthood, you may at times still feel undesirable or different. The old feelings persist. You magnify the differences between yourself and others, making it hard for you to connect. These differences set up a barrier. As soon as you start to get close, you become highly sensitive to areas of dissimilarity.

The lifetrap can have a profound effect on your choice of career. You are probably drawn to activities that do not involve much meaningful social interplay. In fact, becoming good at some solitary activity that can be later turned into a career is often a side-benefit of the lifetrap. You might be an artist. You might be a scientist or a freelance writer. You might be a reporter. You might choose a job that involves a lot of travel, or allows you to work at home. Computers is a common field for people with this lifetrap. You might even start your own company, so that you can have relationships on your own terms. You do not have to worry about other people accepting you. But the last thing you are likely to choose is a job in which your upward mobility depends on having to make contacts and connections with other people. You are not the corporate type who works your way up the ladder through political expertise.

If you do work within a corporation or other organization, you probably feel inferior, or that you do not fit in. You may be excellent at your work, but your lifetrap holds you back.

> DEBRA: *I have the kind of work where I'm supposed to be entertaining clients, taking them out to dinner and for cocktails, but I avoid it It's really hurting me. I don't keep my clients.*

You might even present yourself as odd, eccentric, or aloof.

Escape is your primary means for coping with your lifetrap. It is the rock upon which your Social Exclusion is built. Your avoidance of social situations ensures that nothing can change for you. Your skills cannot improve. Your beliefs cannot be disconfirmed. You are more comfortable, but you are stuck. Changing requires a basic shift from a stance of Escape to one of confrontation and mastery. The people who overcome social exclusion are the ones who make this shift.

On the following page are the steps to overcoming social exclusion.

> **Changing Social Exclusion**

**(1) Understand Your Childhood Social Exclusion. Feel the Isolated or Inferior Child Inside of You.**

The first thing to do is to remember. Let the memories come of yourself as a child, feeling different or excluded by other children. When you have some time alone, darken the room and sit back in a comfortable place. Remember not to force the images. Just close your eyes and let them come. Remember when you felt different or inferior. You can start with an image of a current situation that triggers feelings of Social Exclusion.

Often the memories that come are of being laughed at, humiliated, teased, or bullied, or of being alone, apart from the others, not fitting in. Here is an illustration of Debra's imagery. In one session she was telling us about another miserable party. We asked her to close her eyes and get an image of it.

> DEBRA: *I'm standing next to this guy, who's talking to me. I'm so relieved that someone is talking to me, that I don't have to stand there alone, but Vm so nervous I can't talk to the guy. I'm talking really fast, and I know my eyes look really anxious. I just feel really pressured. He starts to look uncomfortable, and then he finishes the conversation and walks away.    
I left right after that. I haven't gone to a party since.*

> THERAPIST: *Stay with it, and let an image come of when you felt the same way as a child.*

> DEBRA: *Okay. I'm at my friend Gina's house. There are a bunch of kids there. We're picking sides for a game ofkickball, and no one is picking me. I'm the last kid to be picked, and, when the team gets me, they all start to groan.*

Adam's images focused more on being on the outside of groups. One session he told us about a camping trip he took as a child. They swam in a waterfall.

> ADAM: *There were about five of us swimming right near the falls. At one point I dove into the falls and stood there, letting them fall right on top of me. I could see the other kids sort of blurry, and I could hear them muffled through the roar of the falls All of a sudden I felt so alone. I had the thought that it was always like this, with everyone coming at me from far away. And I'm watching, like through a window. Everyone else is out there playing and being normal with each other, and I'm outside looking in.*

Memories of social exclusion are painful. We want you to comfort that excluded child. Imagine yourself as an adult, comforting the child you were. Social exclusion is a cold, lonely feeling. Do not leave your inner child in that cold place. Before you leave the image, bring yourself in as an adult, and give support to your inner child.

> ADAM: *I bring myself in, and I dive into the falls where my childhood self is standing, and I tell him that he is not alone anymore. I am here, and I will help him connect with other people.*

**(2) List Everyday Social Situations in Which You Feel Anxious or Uncomfortable.**

Write down the situations that make you uncomfortable, but which you do not avoid. Your list might include parties, meetings, eating in public, talking in front of a group, dating, talking to people in authority, being assertive, or having a conversation. Here is Debra's list.

> Social Situations That Make Me Anxious but That I Do Not Escape From

> 1. Greeting my doorman.
> 2. Calling prospective clients.
> 3. Lunch at the cafeteria at work.
> 4. The coffee-hour at church.
> 5. Meetings with coworkers.
> 6. Talking to people I don't know well.
> 7. Getting to know the people in my apartment building.

Now make two more columns on the chart. In the second column, for each situation, write down the ways you feel undesirable, different, or inferior. For example, for parties, Debra wrote, "not good-looking, bad  conversationalist, look anxious." For meetings at work, she wrote, "say stupid things when put on the spot, can't relax and chat before and after, don't have the professional look of the others."

Finally, in the last column, write down your worst-case scenario of what could go wrong. Let yourself get a vivid image. What is the catastrophe you fear? Will people laugh at you, or reject you? Will you be exposed as inferior? Or will you fail to fit in, again?

**(3) List Social Situations That You Avoid.**

Here list the situations that you avoid. These are the activities that you would rather, and usually do, avoid. Here is Debra's list.

> Social Situations I Avoid

> 1. Most parties.
> 2. Taking clients out to dinner.
> 3. Dates.
> 4. Asking my boss for favors.
> 5. Inviting people I don't know well to get together with me.
> 6. Going out after work with coworkers.
> 7. Giving presentations at work.

When you have completed your list, make two more columns and go through the same steps as in 3, for each situation. In the second column, write down the ways you feel different or inferior. In the last column, write your worst-case scenario.

**(4) List Ways That You Overcompensate for Feeling Different or Inferior.**

These are the ways you try to prove that the opposite of the lifetrap is true. This is a form of Counterattack. You try to combat the lifetrap by doing everything possible to show that you are not different. You are not undesirable. Here is Adam's list:

> Ways I Overcompensate -for Feeling Different

> 1. I pretend to be like whoever I'm with, just to fit in. I keep my thoughts to myself.
> 2. I don't let people see the strange parts of me (liking foreign films, my short stories, my family).
> 3. When I have a girlfriend, I don't let my friends or family spend time with her. I try to keep my worlds separate.
> 4. I dress more conservatively than I would like to. 
> 5. I try to impress people with how popular I am.
> 6. I try to have friends who are popular.

Similarly, you might overcompensate for feelings of inferiority by becoming inordinately focused on your appearance, or becoming successful in
your career, or struggling to be in, or hiding your flaws. 

Overcompensations like these are fragile. They easily collapse. We want you to build a more solid base. We want you to become open to experiencing social situations anew. You will find they can be quite different from the nightmare experiences of your childhood. Adults are generally more accepting of differences than children and adolescents. They are much less likely to humiliate or reject you.

**(5) Drawing on Steps 1-4, Above, List the Qualities in Yourself That Make You Feel Alienated, Vulnerable, or Inferior.**

Take one sheet of paper for each quality. Make up a title for each sheet (e.g., "The Fat Child," "The Dumb Child"). Then, on each sheet do the following: 

1. Define the quality in specific terms (e.g., fat = over 200 pounds).
2. List all the evidence in your adult life that substantiates your feeling that this is a real flaw.
3. List any evidence that refutes your feeling.
4. Ask friends and family for their opinions about how you fare on each quality.
5. Write a paragraph summarizing the objective evidence. How valid is your self-criticism?

The qualities Margaret listed included "not good-looking," "can't carry on an interesting conversation at parties," "not successful enough," "anxious at social occasions," "I get flippant and say stupid things," and "I make a terrible first impression." Here is the sheet she drew up for "I make a terrible first impression."

> "I Make a Terrible First Impression"

> 1. *Definition*

> People don't like me when they first meet me.

> 2. *Evidence in My Adult Life That This is a Real Flaw*

> I never meet guys at parties. People who don't know me lose interest in talking to me fast at parties. I don't do well at job interviews. People have made fun of the first impression I made on them (for example, Ellen, Bill). I have a lot of trouble meeting new people. People in my apartment building don't seem to like me. They are much friendlier to other people.

> 3. *Evidence from My Adult Life That Refutes the Feeling*

> I have made some new friends since I've been an adult. In fact I have a lot of good friends. When I was in college, the mothers of my boyfriends seemed to like me.

> 4. *Ask My Friends and Family*

> I asked my sister, mother, and two friends. All of them pretty much agreed except my mother. My sister said that I come off as uptight at first. My friends said pretty much the same thing.

> 5. *Summary of the Objective Evidence*

> Although there is evidence that I can sometimes make a good first impression, the majority of the evidence is that this is a real flaw.

Doing this for her other qualities, Margaret admitted that she was probably good-looking and successful enough, but that the other flaws were real.

The qualities Adam listed included:

> Ways I Am Different from Most People

> 1. I don't talk about the same things other people talk about.
> 2. I'm strange.
> 3. People don't want to get to know me.
> 4. I'm too serious. I can't seem to lighten up.
> 5. I dress differently from other people.
> 6. Ihave unusual interests that other people don't seem to have.
> 7. I act so aloof that it puts people off.

After doing his sheets, he decided that "I don't talk about the same things that other people talk about," "I'm too serious. I can't seem to lighten up," and "I act so aloof that it puts people off," were real flaws.

One thing became clear as we evaluated whether Adam's flaws were real or imagined. This was that Adam exaggerated differences between himself and other people. This was one important way he reinforced his lifetrap. He constantly maximized differences and minimized similarities.

> THERAPIST: *Why didn't you feel you could talk to that new manager at work?*

> ADAM: *I just felt like we had nothing in common.*

> THERAPIST: *But you are in the same field. That is something already.*

> ADAM: *But we're different in so many other important ways.*

> THERAPIST: *Like what?*

> ADAM: *Oh, he dresses different, and drives an expensive car.*

> THERAPIST: *But didn't you hear that he's a foreign film buff too?*

> ADAM: Yeah. *But that car of his really put me off. I just figured he's a really materialistic person. And I'm not like that.*

The very way he saw the world—in terms of differences rather than similarities—reinforced Adam's lifetrap.

**(6) If You Are Convinced That a Flaw or Difference Is Real, Write Down Steps You Could Take to Overcome It, Follow Through Gradually with Your Plan of Change.**

You might write things like working to improve your social skills, becoming warmer and more friendly to people, losing or gaining weight, taking a class in public speaking, going back to school, learning to look your best, or any number of other self-improvement  strategies. Gradually do these things. Sometimes when we have a flaw, we shrink from overcoming it. We feel so ashamed that we do not even want to think about it. Resist falling into this trap. Attack your deficiencies head-on.

Debra developed a plan to deal with her "terrible first impression." First, she tried to get direct feedback about what aspects of her behavior were problematic. She did this by observing herself when meeting people, asking friends and family, and doing role-plays of first meetings with us in sessions.

> THERAPIST: *So what can we conclude from all this?*

> DEBRA: *I guess I have two main problems with making a good first impression. The first is that, because I'm so anxious, I make flippant comments that the other person doesn't know are meant as jokes. And the second is that, when people ask me about myself, I don't know what to say.*

Once Debra identified her tendency to be flippant, it was fairly easy for her to stop doing it. She stopped herself from making jokes, at least until she knew the person a little better. In terms of the second problem, knowing what to say when asked about herself, we practiced this in sessions. We prepared Debra to talk about herself in various areas—her work, her family, her interests. Many social skills can be learned through preparation. Planning in advance how to handle various scenarios will reduce your anxiety.

Imagery can also play a large role in your preparation. Instead of spending time before an event imagining catastrophic situations and  making yourself even more afraid—spend time imagining yourself performing well. Imagine yourself performing exactly as you wish. Have dress rehearsals of success rather than failure.

> DEBRA: *Before I went to the company Christmas party, I lay down and relaxed myself, and I imagined the party going very well. I pictured myself walking in and looking around, smiling, and picking one person to go up to and talk to. I imagined walking up and saying, "hi," and feeling composed. I imagined starting to talk, the things I would say.*

**(7) Reevaluate the Importance of Flaws That You Cannot Change.**

Alcoholics Anonymous has a saying: "God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference." There are some things you can change about yourself, and some things you cannot. Beyond self-improvement lies acceptance of yourself.

You may have flaws that you can never change, or never change enough. You will always be too short or tall, you may always be too fat, you may never be successful enough, or tell great stories at parties. However, people with this lifetrap almost always exaggerate the importance of their flaws. Consider this. How significant really are your flaws relative to your other good qualities?

List your good qualities and your flaws. Do the same for people you know. Are you really that much worse, or different, overall? Try to put your flaws in perspective. Debra may be awkward in social situations, but she is also an intelligent, sensitive, and sweet human being. The same for Adam. He is a funny, interesting person whose differences often make him quite charismatic. Our experience of patients with this lifetrap is overwhelmingly that their flaws pale against the backdrop of the person as a whole.

You probably believe that other adults regard your flaws in the same light as the children who made fun of you in childhood. But you are wrong. Adults are usually much more tolerant of differences than children. Adults appreciate differences more. It is only children—or immature adults—who feel that pressure to be exactly the same.

> DEBRA: *When I'm at a party I feel the same as back on the playground at school. I feel like it's recess, and everybody's making fun of me. I half expect people to start ganging up on me and start chanting songs about how fat I am.*

Finally, you may have flaws that you do not want to change. Some of your so-called flaws may be valued parts of yourself. This is how Adam finally felt about the way he dressed. He enjoyed buying clothes and creating outfits. He was not about to give it up. The way he dressed was distinctive but not outrageous. Debra had a similar issue about makeup. She was not willing to wear it, even if it would enhance her chances of meeting a man.

How much you are willing to change yourself is ultimately your decision. But you must be aware of the consequences of what you do. If 
fitting in is your goal, then flaunting your uniqueness is not going to help you reach it. One of the most challenging tasks in life is finding a balance between fitting in or being normal, and expressing our unique, individual natures. If we go too far toward conformity, we lose a sense of who we really are; if we go to the extreme of individual expression and uniqueness, we cannot fit in with the rest of the community.

**(8) Make a Flashcard for Each Flaw.**

Make flashcards to carry around with you. Read them each time your lifetrap is triggered. In this way you can chip away at the lifetrap.

When you are writing a flashcard, emphasize ways you are exaggerating the flaw. Mention your good qualities. Include ways you can improve.

We will give you some examples. Here is the card Debra wrote for the flaw, "I am anxious at social occasions."

> **Social Exclusion Flashcard #1**

> I know that right now I feel anxious, as if everyone is looking at me. I feel like I can't talk to anyone. But it is just my lifetrap being triggered. If I look around, I will see that people are not looking at me. And even if someone is, it is probably a friendly look. If I start talking to people, in a little while my anxiety will grow less. People can't really tell I'm anxious. Besides, other people are anxious too. Everyone is a little anxious in social situations. I can start by relaxing my body, looking around the room, and finding one person to talk to.

Here is the card Adam wrote for the flaw, "I act so aloof that it puts people off."

> **Social Exclusion Flashcard #2**

> I'm starting to feel different from the people I'm with. I'm feeling like an outsider, alone in the crowd. I am holding myself back, becoming aloof. But this is my lifetrap kicking in. In fact I'm exaggerating how different I am. If I become friendlier, I will find that we have tilings in common. I just have to give myself a chance to connect.

A flashcard can help break the spell of the lifetrap, and get you back on the right track.

**(9) Make a Hierarchy of Social and Work Groups You Have Been Escaping. Gradually Move Up the Hierarchy.**

This is the most crucial step. Stop escaping! Of all the factors that maintain your lifetrap, avoidance is the most important. As long as you keep running away, your lifetrap cannot change.

By the time we reach adulthood, the likelihood of people rejecting us is lower than it was in childhood. As most people get older, they become more tolerant and accepting. But you do not see this. You are frozen in childhood, unaware that the world has changed around you. You ascribe the mentality of a child to the adults around you. So you avoid situations where you might get exactly the positive feedback that you need. You never find out that you might actually be accepted.

We realize this step will be difficult for you. We will make it as easy as we can. The reason you try to escape is that you experience such high anxiety in social situations. You will do almost anything to avoid experiencing this anxiety. And what is more, with the Social Exclusion lifetrap, it is possible to live your life avoiding almost all social situations. You can still get by, even though your life lacks an important dimension of gratification.

Take the list you made in step 3, of group situations that you avoid. Rate how difficult it would be to complete each item, using the following scale. (Use any number from 0 to 8.)

> Scale of Difficulty

> 0 Very Easy    
> 2 Mildly Difficult    
> 4 Moderately Difficult    
> 6 Very Difficult    
> 8 Feels Almost Impossible

For example, Debra rated the items on her list as shown on the following page.

SOCIAL SITUATIONS I AVOID DIFFICULTY and RATING

1. Most parties. 8
2. Taking clients out to dinner. 5
3. Dates. 6
4. Asking my boss for favors. 4
5. Inviting people I don't know well to get together with me. 7
6. Going out after work with coworkers. 3
7. Giving presentations at work. 8


Start with the least difficult item. (Make sure you have included some relatively easy items—some l's, 2's, and 3's.) Do this item over and over until you have achieved a sense of mastery over that level of difficulty. Debra's easiest item was "going out after work with coworkers." She did this several times a month for five months before she moved up to her next hierarchy item.

Debra made up other items at level 3 difficulty, and did those too. She chatted with people she knew in passing, such as doormen and store clerks. She struck up conversations with men she found moderately attractive. By the time she got to level 4, she felt ready. We want you to do the same. At each level of difficulty, make up other items and do those. And plan carefully how you will complete each item. Think everything through in advance. Work out solutions to many possible eventualities. Use positive imagery to practice performing well.

Gradually move up your hierarchy. Your successes will sustain you as you go. The hardest part is getting started. Take a chance and start growing socially again. You might even find that you enjoy it.

**(10) When You Are in Groups, Make a Concerted Effort to Initiate Conversations.**

When you attend a social event, set yourself a goal of starting a certain number of conversations to initiate, then try to meet your target. Orient yourself toward the outside world. People with this lifetrap spend too much social time staying in their own head. They do not connect. Even though they have entered the social situation, they are still escaping real contact. They are there, yet not really there. You have to overcome this more subtle form of Escape as well.

When Debra and Adam practiced their hierarchy items, they would agree to talk to a specific number of people. Going to a party, they would say something like, "I'll talk to at least two people that I don't know." This is what we want you to do. You will be surprised to find out that setting a specific goal will often reduce your anxiety rather than increase it. Once the anticipatory anxiety has passed, you will probably find that walking up and talking to people greatly decreases your anxiety. This is how it usually works with avoidance. You predict that you will be much more anxious than you actually are.

> DEBRA: *It really wasn't bad at all. I talked to two people during the coffee break, and it wasn 't that bad. And next time I go, it will be much better, because now I have some people I can talk to.*

Try to make friends with one person in the group, then expand to other group members gradually. This is a strategy which we have found helpful. Focusing on the group as a whole is too overwhelming. You feel the group's eyes on you. Break the group down into manageable units. Conquer it one or two people at a time.

**(11) Be Yourself in Groups.** 

There is another more subtle form of avoidance. This is to hide parts of yourself. You talk to people, but you are secretive or careful to avoid certain topics, so that your defect or difference will not be exposed. Perhaps it is that you are gay, or unsuccessful, or from a certain family background. Or maybe it is a physical characteristic, or some aspect of your status—such as education or income.

You pay too high a price for keeping these secrets. Meeting people becomes fraught with tension and loneliness. As one of our patients once said, "Having a secret is isolating." Try, as much as possible, not to hide your flaws or perceived differences. We are not saying to be outrageously different. We are simply saying to be yourself. Let people know that you are gay or from a certain family background. Stop hiding it. As you get to know people better, share some of your vulnerabilities and insecurities. It is the only way for you to find out that you are acceptable nevertheless.

**(12) Stop Trying So Hard to Overcompensate for Your Perceived Areas of Undesirability.**

Allow yourself to see that most people will accept you for who you are—not for trying to impress them with your accomplishments or possessions. Resist that pressure. You will find that it is a relief to give up this pressure. 

> ADAM: *Having to prove all the time that I was a popular guy was a burden. I was always lying about who I was. I really don't want to have to do it anymore.*

Debra had a similar issue about her lack of success. Because she was ashamed of her work situation, she constantly tried to prove to people how smart she was. If the subject of work came up at all, her conversation would grow strained and artificial.

> DEBRA: *I would almost start bragging really. No matter what we were talking about, I'd manage to drop in some comment about how I won an award in college or something. Maybe start talking about some complicated theory. Or all of a sudden become really condescending. It would sound really hollow. I mean the other person would know exactly how I really felt.*


Not only is counterattacking like this a burden, but your behavior is transparent as well. Other people see right through you. They know you feel ashamed inside. The showing off is false. You know it, and they know it too. Replace the person that you pretend to be with the person you really are. People will like you better, and you will like yourself better as well.

We are not saying that you should start talking yourself down. Rather, we are saying to calm down, to stop trying so hard to impress people.

### SOME FINAL WORDS

The journey out of Social Exclusion is a journey from loneliness to connection. Try to see it in this positive light. If you are willing to apply these change strategies, you will find that there are many rewards. Debra is now dating, enjoying herself at parties, going out several nights a week. She comes to her sessions happy. Adam has made some new close friends with whom he shares the truth about himself. The ultimate reward is a  satisfying social life. You can feel part of a group or the community. This is a vital part of life, of which you are now deprived. Why miss out in this way?

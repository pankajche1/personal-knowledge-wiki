> **Margaret:** Twenty-eight years old, feels trapped in her marriage to an abusive husband.

When Margaret first walks into our office there is a frightened look in her eyes. It raises a protective impulse in us and we move to take care of her. When we tell her she seems frightened, she tells us that she does not even like to think about her problems, let alone talk about them.

Margaret feels trapped in a relationship that she is too afraid to leave. She is afraid to be alone. Anthony, her husband, is verbally abusive. He has been unemployed for two years and blames her. In fact, he blames her for all his problems. Margaret is agoraphobic: she has panic attacks and
avoids many situations for fear that she will have an attackâ€”trains, restaurants, grocery stores, shopping malls, crowds, movie theaters. On some days she is so anxious that she is afraid to leave her home. She has come to therapy because coping with her marriage and her phobias has become too much for her.

As you might imagine, aside from making day-to-day functioning difficult, Margaret's agoraphobia sharply decreases her pleasure from her leisure  time. Activities that other people find enjoyable, she experiences as onerous tasks.

> MARGARET: *Anthony is mad at me. He wants me to meet him at the restaurant tomorrow night. He doesn't want to have to come home first and get me. But I just can't do it. I can't get on the train.*

> THERAPIST: *What are you afraid of?*

> MARGARET: *What if something happens to me and there is no one to take care of me?*

> THERAPIST: *What might happen to you?*

> MARGARET: *What might happen to me? My panic might get so bad that I'd collapse on the street.*

When Margaret is home, if Anthony has to leave for some reason, she, too, finds herself rushing out of the house. Or she starts to make telephone calls: "My telephone is my lifeline to the world." Although Anthony complains angrily about the cost to him of baby-sitting her, whenever she strikes out on her own, he seems to discourage her. In a strange way, Margaret feels he wants to keep her dependent.

> **William:** Thirty-four years old, is still dependent on his parents to take care of him.

William, too, has a frightened look when he walks into our office. He seems to be a shy, quiet man. He has an air of timidity. And he also moves us to take care of him, to try to make him comfortable. We find we are gentle with him.

William is still living with his parents. He had left home for an extended period of time only once, when he went to college. It lasted one year: after that, he transferred to a small school close enough that he could live at home and commute. William became an accountant like his father,
and he works in his father's firm. He is extremely anxious about his work. He has been dating a woman named Carol for a long time, but somehow
finds it hard to make a commitment. He cannot decide if she is the right person for him.

> WILLIAM: *I keep thinking, "What if I'm making a mistake, what if she's not the one? What if there's someone better? How do I know if she's the
right one, or if I'm just settling for less?" We get along, but there just aren't fireworks. And what if I can't support her? She wants to have a lot of kids. How do I know that I can support a wife and kids? I can barely support myself. Sometimes I think I should just break up with her now, and get it over with.*

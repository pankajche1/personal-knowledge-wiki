> **Margaret:** Twenty-eight years old, feels trapped in her marriage to an abusive husband.

When Margaret first walks into our office there is a frightened look in her eyes. It raises a protective impulse in us and we move to take care of her. When we tell her she seems frightened, she tells us that she does not even like to think about her problems, let alone talk about them.

Margaret feels trapped in a relationship that she is too afraid to leave. She is afraid to be alone. Anthony, her husband, is verbally abusive. He has been unemployed for two years and blames her. In fact, he blames her for all his problems. Margaret is agoraphobic: she has panic attacks and
avoids many situations for fear that she will have an attackâ€”trains, restaurants, grocery stores, shopping malls, crowds, movie theaters. On some days she is so anxious that she is afraid to leave her home. She has come to therapy because coping with her marriage and her phobias has become too much for her.

As you might imagine, aside from making day-to-day functioning difficult, Margaret's agoraphobia sharply decreases her pleasure from her leisure  time. Activities that other people find enjoyable, she experiences as onerous tasks.

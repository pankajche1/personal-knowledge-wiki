Why another self-help book?

We believe that Reinventing Your Life fills an important gap in the books currently available for self-improvement. There are many excellent self-help books, just as there are many fine therapy approaches. However, most of these are limited. Some books only deal with one specific  problem, like codependency, depression, lack of assertiveness, or making poor partner choices. Some deal with many problems, but only use one means of change, like inner-child work, couples exercises, or cognitive-behavioral methods. Other books are inspirational or do a great job of describing a universal problem like loss, but the solutions they offer are so vague that we don't know how to go about changing once we have the inspiration.

**Q:** Why does this book fill an important gap in the books currently available for self improvement?    
**Ans:** If you see the other books for self improvemnet, you will find that they deal with one specifice problem like *depression* or *lack of assertiveness*. Or there are books that tell you only one means of change, like *inner-child work*, *cognitive behavioral method*. Other books are inspirational. But they give very vague solution for changing our life.

In Reinventing Your Life, Janet Klosko and I share with you a new therapy for changing major life patterns. Lifetrap therapy addresses eleven of the most destructive problems we encounter every day in our practices. To help you change these lifetraps, we combine techniques from several different therapies. As a result, we think this book will provide you with a far more thorough and comprehensive approach to a variety of lifelong problems than most books you have read so far.

**Q:** What is the new therapy invented in this book?    
**Ans:** After analysis of patients some same life patterns are found that create life problems. These are called *lifetraps* of *schemas*.  There are 11 of such lifetraps the create the most destructive problems in everyday life. To change these lifetraps this book combines techniques from several different therapies. This way you will get a far more thorough and comprehensive approach to a variety of lifelong problems.

Thus by developing a list of lifetraps, I could break down patients' problems into manageable parts. I could also develop different strategies for solving each problem or pattern.

**Keys:** 

1. list of common themes or patterns in difficult patients: lifetraps or schemas
2. There are 11 such patterns
3. This list of lifetraps breaks down patients' problems into manageable parts.
4. Then, different stratagies can be used to chip away these lifetraps little by little

Since this book is about personal growth and change, I'd like to describe the path I followed leading to the development of lifetraps therapy. In many respects my development as a therapist mirrors the journey of self-discovery we outline for you in this book.

It began in 1975 when I was a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania. I remember my first experience doing therapy as an intern at a community mental-health center in Philadelphia. I was learning Rogerian therapy, a nondirective approach. I remember feeling stymied much of the time. Patients would come to me with serious life problems, expressing powerful emotions, and I was taught to listen, to paraphrase, and to clarify so patients could arrive at their own solutions. The problem, of course, was that often they didn't. Or, if they did come to their own resolution, it took so long that I became terribly frustrated by the time therapy was over. Rogerian therapy did not fit my temperament, my natural inclinations. Perhaps I am too impatient, but I like to see change and progress relatively quickly. I become easily frustrated in  circumstances where there is a serious problem and I have to sit by helplessly watching, unable to correct it.

Within a short time, I began reading about behavior therapy, an approach that stresses rapid, concrete behavior change. I felt an enormous relief. I could be active and offer advice to patients instead of being so passive. Behavior therapy offered a well laid out framework that explained why patients had specific problems and exactly which techniques to use. It was almost like a cookbook or technical manual. In comparison with the vague approach I had originally learned, the behavioral model was very appealing. It was geared toward fast, short-term change.

After a couple of years, I became disillusioned with behavior therapy as well. In focusing so narrowly on what people do, I began to feel that behavior therapy had gone too far in ignoring our thoughts and feelings. I was missing the richness of patients' internal worlds. At this point I read Dr. Aaron Beck's book, Cognitive Therapy and the Emotional Disorders, and became excited again. Beck was combining the practicality and  directness of behavior therapy with the richness of patients' thoughts and beliefs.

After graduate school in 19791 began studying cognitive therapy with Dr. Beck. I loved demonstrating to patients how their thoughts were distorted and showing them rational alternatives. I also liked pinpointing problem behaviors and rehearsing new ways of handling everyday situations. Patients began to change in dramatic ways: their depression lifted, anxiety symptoms went away. I also found that the techniques of cognitive therapy were extremely valuable to me in my personal life. I began  spreading the word about cognitive therapy to other professionals through  lectures and workshops in the United States and Europe.

After a few years, I started my own private practice in Philadelphia. I continued to have dramatic results with many patients, especially those with specific symptoms like depression and anxiety. Unfortunately, as time went on, I built up a backlog of patients who were not responding at all or who showed only slight improvement. I decided to sit down and figure out what these patients had in common. I also asked colleagues of mine who were cognitive therapists to describe their resistant patients. I wanted to see whether their therapy failures were similar to my own.

What I found in trying to distinguish difficult patients from the ones who responded quickly was a revelation to me. The most difficult patients tended to have less severe symptoms; in general, they were less depressed and anxious. Many of their problems concerned intimacy: these patients had patterns of unsatisfactory relationships. Furthermore, most of these resistant patients had experienced their problems for most of their lives. They were not coming to therapy because of a single life crisis, like divorce or the death of a parent. These patients all had self-destructive life patterns.

Next I decided to make a list of the most common themes or patterns in these difficult patients. This became my first list of schemas, or lifetraps. It only had a few of the eleven patterns described in Reinventing Your Life, such as deep feelings of defectiveness, a sense of profound isolation and loneliness, a tendency to sacrifice their needs for those of other people, and an unhealthy dependence or reliance on others. These lifetraps proved invaluable to me in working with patients who previously had been unresponsive to treatment. I found that by developing a list of lifetraps, I could break down patients' problems into manageable parts. I could also develop different strategies for solving each problem or pattern.

In retrospect, my search for broad themes and patterns was also very consistent with my own personality. I've always longed to see various aspects of my life as part of an organized whole, with some sense of order and predictability. I've always felt that I could gain control over my own life by extracting these general themes or patterns. I remember as a college student trying to classify my roommates into various categories of  friendship, depending on how much I felt they could be relied upon.

Another thread in my own development as a therapist has been my increasing desire to integrate and blend, rather than eliminate or criticize. Many therapists feel they must choose one approach to therapy and follow it with devotion. That is why we have strict Gestalt therapists, family therapists, Freudian therapists, and behavior therapists. I have come to believe that integrating the best components of several therapies is far more effective than any one alone. There is much of value in psychoanalytic, experiential, cognitive, pharmacological, and behavioral approaches, but each has significant limitations when used alone.

On the other hand, I am also opposed to combining many different techniques haphazardly without a unifying framework. I believe that the eleven lifetraps provide that unifying framework, and that techniques drawn from several approaches can be combined, like an arsenal of weapons, to fight these lifetraps. Furthermore, as described in the chapters that follow, these lifetraps can provide you with a sense of continuity over the course of your life; the past and present can be seen as part of a consistent whole. Each lifetrap has an understandable origin in childhood that  intuitively feels right to us. We can understand, for example, why we are drawn to critical partners, and why we feel so badly about ourselves when we make a mistake, once we grasp how demanding and punitive our own parents were.

I hope that Reinventing Your Life fills the need for a book that deals comprehensively with a broad range of deeply felt, lifelong problems we all face. I also hope that it provides you with a useful framework for understanding how these patterns developed, along with powerful solutions for each lifetrap, drawn from many different psychological approaches that can really work for you.

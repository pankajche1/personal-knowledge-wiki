Are you always comparing yourself to others – and feel that you don’t measure up? You may have an inferiority complex. Here’s what to do about it.
Does everyone you know seem to be more successful, popular, funny, intelligent or attractive than you? Do you feel like you’re worthless, and just not ‘good enough’? Or do you hide the ‘real you’ and present a false self to the world?</description>

      <description>The trader-philosopher-statistician Nassim Taleb could also be considered a psychologist. In The Black Swan, Taleb introduced the notion of a narrative fallacy to describe how flawed stories of the past shape our views of the world and our expectations for the future. Narrative fallacies arise inevitably from our continuous attempt to make sense of the world. The explanatory stories that people find compelling are simple; are concrete rather than abstract; assign a larger role to talent, stupidity, and intentions than to luck; and focus on a few striking events that happened rather than on the countless events that failed to happen.</description>

      <description>Life presents us with many occasions to forecast. Economists forecast inflation and unemployment, financial analysts forecast earnings, military experts predict casualties, venture capitalists assess profitability, publishers and producers predict audiences, contractors estimate the time required to complete projects, chefs anticipate the demand for the dishes on their menu, engineers estimate the amount of concrete needed for a building, fireground commanders assess the number of trucks that will be needed to put out a fire.</description>

      <description>I just made my album. I did my best. And I uploaded the video just to YouTube. That was all.
  —Park Jae-sang, better known by his stage name PSY
 What impact have social media and networking tools had on exporting? They are redefining the way we connect with people and how we innovate and conduct business across the world. Using blogs, LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and Google+ to globally establish and build your brand on the Internet is a great way for customers to find you online—so that it doesn’t have to work the other way around.</description>

      <description>Introduction [2022-02-22 Tue 19:38]
The writer found that rewards work better than punishment
I had one of the most satisfying eureka experiences of my career while teaching flight instructors in the Israeli Air Force about the psychology of effective training. I was telling them about an important principle of skill training: rewards for improved performance work better than punishment of mistakes. This proposition is supported by much evidence from research on pigeons, rats, humans, and other animals.</description>

      <description>Q: What is there in this chapter?
Ans: Corporate, Legal, Financial, and Logistical Considerations
 This is the company of the future. Forget about “outsourcing.” In today’s hyperconnected world, there is no “in” and no “out.” There’s only “good, better and best,” and if you don’t assemble the best team you can from everywhere, your competitor will.
  —Best-selling author and New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman (2012)

      <description>In the language of this book, we had observed a failure of System 2: our participants had a fair opportunity to detect the relevance of the logical rule, since both outcomes were included in the same ranking. They did not take advantage of that opportunity. When we extended the experiment, we found that 89% of the undergraduates in our sample violated the logic of probability. We were convinced that statistically sophisticated respondents would do better, so we administered the same questionnaire to doctoral students in the decision-science program of the Stanford Graduate School of Business, all of whom had taken several advanced courses in probability, statistics, and decision theory.</description>

      <description>Introduction Consider the following scenario and note your intuitive answer to the question.
 A cab was involved in a hit-and-run accident at night. Two cab companies, the Green and the Blue, operate in the city. You are given the following data:
  85% of the cabs in the city are Green and 15% are Blue. A witness identified the cab as Blue. The court tested the reliability of the witness under the circumstances that existed on the night of the accident and concluded that the witness correctly identified each one of the two colors 80% of the time and failed 20% of the time.</description>

      <description>Are you repeatedly drawn into relationships with people who are cold to you? Do you feel that even the people closest to you do not care or understand enough about you?
  Do you feel that you are at your core somehow defective, that no one who truly knows you could possibly love and accept you?
  Do you put the needs of others above your own, so your needs never get met—and so you do not even know what your real needs are?</description>

      <description>[2022-03-02 Wed 17:55]
System 1 is designed to jump to conclusions from little evidence—and it is not designed to know the size of its jumps. Because of WYSIATI, only the evidence at hand counts. Because of confidence by coherence, the subjective confidence we have in our opinions reflects the coherence of the story that System 1 and System 2 have constructed. The amount of evidence and its quality do not count for much, because poor evidence can make a very good story.</description>

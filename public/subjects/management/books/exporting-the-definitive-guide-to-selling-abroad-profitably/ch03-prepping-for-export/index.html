<strong>Ans:</strong> Corporate, Legal, Financial, and Logistical Considerations</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the company of the future. Forget about “outsourcing.” In today’s hyperconnected world, there is no “in” and no “out.” There’s only “good, better and best,” and if you don’t assemble the best team you can from everywhere, your competitor will.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What are you missing till now in your business plan? (Pankaj) <br>
<strong>Ans:</strong> You are not thinking of assembling a good team. You never had this idea.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Now that you&rsquo;ve set up your business plan. What is the next task? <br>
<strong>Ans:</strong> It’s time to delve a little deeper into assembling your export company. The next step is tackling the essential details of a sound legal, fiscal, and logistical operation. You’ll be faced with obstacles ranging from expanding your enterprise, protecting your company, and choosing a product name and other intellectual property to opening a bank account in your home country, sourcing financing, and dealing with special tax situations. Not all of these issues will come into play immediately, but you will do well to familiarize yourself with the framework in which you
will be operating right from the start.</p>

<p><em>Key:</em> It’s time to delve a little deeper into assembling your export company. The next step is tackling the essential details of a sound legal, fiscal, and logistical operation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the expansion of any business tests us on numerous fronts—from hiring the right people to covering fixed expenses and revenue generation—
expanding internationally through exports performed primarily via the Internet challenges us in a whole new way that could potentially interrupt the viability of a business. When reengineering your business from local to export-ready, you must take into consideration bullet-proofing processes, additional laws governing intellectual property, hiring and firing, contracts, and marketing and financial management, as well as settling international disputes.</p>
<p>Prepping for export success boils down to careful planning (refer back to Chapter 2 on crafting a business plan), being proactive in seizing opportunities, and holding transparent discussions with trusted advisors on where you are headed to ensure every move you make is done with confidence and leads to greater growth and prosperity for your business.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the Export Dream Team (EBT)? <br>
<strong>Ans:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Line Up Your Export Dream Team</strong></p>
<p>One of the first things you should do before officially setting up your export business, or if you are an established enterprise and haven’t done so already, is to find yourself a good lawyer, a knowledgeable accountant, savvy banker, and logistics expert, each of whom should specialize in international transactions. They are your export dream team (EDT).</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> But, the above people are expansive. Can I go without them? <br>
<strong>Ans:</strong> You may feel that you can’t afford to pay for these professional services, but in truth, you can’t afford to do without them.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the <em>fab four</em>? <br>
<strong>Ans:</strong> Fab means fabulous or wonderful. These are fab four:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lawyer</li>
<li>Accountant</li>
<li>Banker</li>
<li>Logistics Expert</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> How to get a good lawyer? <br>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is tip if the thought of using the <em>big</em> bank guys intimidate you? <br>
<strong>Ans:</strong> Even though the thought of using the big bank guys might intimidate you, once you are a customer—and that could be only the basis of depositing $250 to open an account—you are entitled to free consultations with the international banking experts to help you better manage your export business.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the role of a logistics expert? <br>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What are <em>freight forwarders</em>? <br>
<strong>Ans:</strong> Freight forwarders often serve the same purpose, but they do so on a more-niche basis (by industry or geographic location). They too organize shipments to get goods from one point to a final destination.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How should you use the above two organizations? <br>
<strong>Ans:</strong> Any of these types of organizations are effective and serve as an architect for transport. Before you send your product off on a boat, get comfortable with one point person to help you navigate the choppy waters and ask her about her resources and whether she has people on the ground in the country where you desire to conduct business. And, as always, have a backup logistic provider in case something goes awry in a country where business is booming.</p>

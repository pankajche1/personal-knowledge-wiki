<strong>Ans:</strong> Create an Environment Where People Will Flourish.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What results will be produced if you have wrong people with you? <br>
<strong>Ans:</strong> Great vision with mediocre people produces mediocre results.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have the wrong people on [your] bus, nothing else matters. You may be headed in the right direction, but you still won’t achieve greatness. Great vision with mediocre people still produces mediocre results. <br>
—Jim Collins, business consultant, <br>
<em>best-selling author and lecturer (2001)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> You have brilliant idea and well-organized plan. Still, what is the basic and most important side of your business? <br>
<strong>Ans:</strong> Jim Collins has it right. No matter what brilliant idea or well-organized plan you have in place for exporting, the basic and most important side of your enterprise is still the human side.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the importance of having good people with you? <br>
<strong>Ans:</strong> It starts with getting the right people on your export bus. Whether you hire employees with full benefits and perks or independent contractors, you want excellent people around you who are as passionate about your company’s prospects as you are and who can do something you can’t do that will help transform your export business.</p>
<p>Complementary values help, but accumulating talent with qualities unlike your own fortifies achieving a vision faster. Although the vision is yours, the talent will be ones with the skill set to get things done.</p>

<p>What impact have social media and networking tools had on exporting? They are redefining the way we connect with people and how we innovate and
conduct business across the world. Using blogs, LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and Google+ to globally establish and build your brand on the Internet is a great way for customers to find you online—so that it doesn’t have to work the other way around. Once that happens, you can open the online door to export your goods to a worldwide customer base. You’ll see how here.</p>
<h3 id="the-bid-shift">The Bid Shift</h3>
<p>As little as five years ago, brick-and-mortar retail operations, such as specialty bakeries, dry cleaners, and businesses displaying their newest fashions in store windows, hummed along nicely based on a local community of loyal customers. When the customers fell short, the business owner ramped up his marketing efforts by way of telephone solicitations, direct-mail pieces, cross-promoted coupons, a big display ad in a telephone book, billboards, or in-store banners to get the word out to the neighborhood that the shop was not only still open for business but also had some very cool things that they had just gotten in for sale. That marketing effort, considered a staple back then, always involved the same customer base: a local one. The business owner had a single-minded view of the possibilities of where his customers could come from, and he didn’t have the means to go beyond those places to reach them. He also didn’t have the time nor the means to make a change that might lead to a brighter future.</p>
<p>Fast forward to now, when companies and individuals are making the big shift away from the old, entrenched way of doing things by offering goods and services to a new export market-driven way of creating growth by developing a digital presence. This digital presence has the potential to reach more than two billion people and save—across the all businesses that export—thousands of dollars in the costs of printing, real estate, education, distribution, human capital, and customer acquisitions.</p>
<p>The need for all businesses to have a digital presence is here to stay and will only continue to evolve and grow in new ways. Individuals and businesses who fail to adapt and make the big shift will fall to the wayside and become irrelevant. Those who embrace the shift, leverage it, and discipline themselves to stay one step ahead of technology will allow every aspect of their business to prosper. The digital world represents one of the greatest challenges and opportunities facing individuals and companies today.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Think of the last time you were at a formal business gathering and a discussion came up about Facebook or LinkedIn. Did everyone jump in to talk about it? Those who don’t are either shy or probably won’t be part of tomorrow’s workforce. Will that be you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks to digital tools and resources, anything—from a book, to a watch, to a political campaign—can be launched, produced, or exported worldwide fairly cheaply. More and more companies are therefore using the Internet, particularly social media platforms, to enhance the way their business is established, discovered, and operated outside their physical boundaries and, as a result, many are growing by leaps and bounds. After all, more than one-third of the world’s population is online. The same folks who have a big online voice are redesigning how their teams work, reassessing how to best serve their customers—no matter where they come from—and changing the very nature of their business.</p>
<p>What will your customers want tomorrow? Where will they be located? Provided you are curious and have the drive, the Internet allows you to find new customers, create the products they want, and export to them.</p>
<h3 id="the-art-of-getting-online-attention-finding-digital-export-success">The Art of Getting Online Attention: Finding Digital Export Success</h3>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Who is PSY? <br>
<strong>Ans:</strong> Park Jae-sang, known professionally as Psy, is a South Korean singer, rapper, songwriter, and record producer.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How do you make a digital dent in the online universe? <br>
<strong>Ans:</strong> Not everyone is as lucky as PSY, who had a music video in 2012 that exceeded one billion views on YouTube. Getting online attention (usually) requires not only one single act of greatness but rather thousands of attempts at greatness spread across many online platforms over a protracted period of time—that’s how you capture attention and develop a following. There is not a one-size-fits-all digital strategy. Succeeding in the digital world requires hard work, discipline, organizational skills, something remarkable to talk about, and a long-term view.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What does it require for succeeding in the digital world? <br>
<strong>Ans:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>hard work</li>
<li>discipline</li>
<li>organizational skills</li>
<li>something remarkable to talk about</li>
<li>a long-term view.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What’s digital-export success? <br>
<strong>Ans:</strong> It is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>people worldwide finding you</li>
<li>opening their wallets to buy something from you</li>
<li>and you fulfilling their requests profitably.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What need you do to be found? <br>
<strong>Ans:</strong> To be found, you must participate and be active on as many of the top on-line platforms as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How to have customers open their wallets to buy something from you? <br>
<strong>Ans:</strong> To have customers open their wallets requires developing a relationship with them, garnering their trust, and offering products they
want. That causes people to take action.</p>
<p>Don’t think for a minute you can foster online success with a single stunning Instagram platform. It’s a start but must be supported with a Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Google+ presence. Putting all these social platforms to work in concert creates a winning online strategy, provided you stick to one topic or theme you are knowledgeable about. Think Mello Yello, Samsung, and Ford Fiesta—all good examples of companies utilizing social platforms with a unified marketing message.</p>
<p><strong>Key:</strong> you stick to one topic or theme you are knowledgeable about, unified marketing message</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How to achieve the goal of having a big picuture view of what you are trying to accomplish? <br>
<strong>Ans:</strong> The goal is to have a holistic or big picture view of what you are trying to accomplish with your export business and make sure the right messages get in front of the right people at the right time. The beauty with this approach to online marketing is that any person at any age now has the capacity to create content, be consistent, control messaging, engage people’s hearts and minds to build a brand, integrate multiple platforms, and measure results—all things that are central to online success.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why did it take Madonna decades to reach global success? <br>
<strong>Ans:</strong> PSY, of course, is a rarity. He came out of nowhere with his YouTube video sensation. After being propelled to global stardom, he must
now harness the attention and energy of Internet users worldwide, sustain the momentum—even raise the bar—and turn his stunning one-hit wonder into a profitable enterprise that supports his goals and values in life. It took Madonna decades to reach her pinnacle of global superstar success. Had she had the luxury of the web at hand when she started out, she could have shortened the discovery of her talent to that of PSY’s. When it comes to stardom, the Internet gives equal access to everyone—of all ages, backgrounds, and ethnic nationalities—and can make success happen overnight, provided all the social platforms are put to good use.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Your social media and networking presence will allow you to broaden and deepen existing relationships, attract new prospects around the globe, build thought leadership within your industry, create strong brand awareness, and grow your business. Once you’ve mastered the basics, you are ready to use eBay, Amazon, Etsy CafePress, and Zazzle—and even the popular Chinese site Alibaba—as stepping stones to exporting.</p>

<p>Are you always comparing yourself to others – and feel that you don’t measure up? You may have an inferiority complex. Here’s what to do about it.</p>
<p>Does everyone you know seem to be more successful, popular, funny, intelligent or attractive than you? Do you feel like you’re worthless, and just not ‘good enough’? Or do you hide the ‘real you’ and present a false self to the world? Maybe you’ve even started avoiding social situations because other people’s apparent confidence and success makes you feel bad about yourself. Do you ever ask yourself: “Why do I feel inferior?”</p>
<p>We all feel like we don’t measure up sometimes – usually as a result of a specific, temporary situation. But if you <em>always</em> feel like this, it’s possible you have an inferiority complex. Here’s what it is – and what to do about it.</p>

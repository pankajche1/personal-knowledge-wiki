experts predict casualties, venture capitalists assess profitability, publishers and producers predict audiences, contractors estimate the time
required to complete projects, chefs anticipate the demand for the dishes on their menu, engineers estimate the amount of concrete needed for a

<p>Some predictive judgments, such as those made by engineers, rely largely on look-up tables, precise calculations, and explicit analyses of outcomes observed on similar occasions. Others involve intuition and System 1, in two main varieties. Some intuitions draw primarily on skill and expertise acquired by repeated experience. The rapid and automatic judgments and choices of chess masters, fireground commanders, and physicians that Gary Klein has described in Sources of Power and elsewhere illustrate these skilled intuitions, in which a solution to the current problem comes to mind quickly because familiar cues are recognized.</p>
<p>Other intuitions, which are sometimes subjectively indistinguishable from the first, arise from the operation of heuristics that often substitute an easy question for the harder one that was asked. Intuitive judgments can be made with high confidence even when they are based on nonregressive
assessments of weak evidence. Of course, many judgments, especially in the professional domain, are influenced by a combination of analysis and intuition.</p>
<h3 id="nonregressive-intuitions">Nonregressive Intuitions</h3>
<p>Let us return to a person we have already met:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Julie is currently a senior in a state university. She read fluently when she was four years old. What is her grade point average (GPA)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People who are familiar with the American educational scene quickly come up with a number, which is often in the vicinity of 3.7 or 3.8. How does this occur? Several operations of System 1 are involved.</p>
<ul>
<li>A causal link between the evidence (Julie’s reading) and the target of the prediction (her GPA) is sought. The link can be indirect. In this
instance, early reading and a high GDP are both indications of academic talent. Some connection is necessary. You (your System 2) would probably reject as irrelevant a report of Julie winning a fly fishing competition or excelling at weight lifting in high school. The process is effectively dichotomous. We are capable of rejecting information as irrelevant or false, but adjusting for smaller weaknesses in the evidence is not something that System 1 can do. As a result, intuitive predictions are almost completely insensitive to the actual predictive quality of the evidence. When a link is found, as in the case of Julie’s early reading, WYSIATI applies: your associative memory quickly and automatically constructs the best
possible story from the information available.</li>
<li>Next, the evidence is evaluated in relation to a relevant norm. How precocious is a child who reads fluently at age four? What relative rank or percentile score corresponds to this achievement? The group to which the child is compared (we call it a reference group) is not fully specified, but this is also the rule in normal speech: if someone graduating from college is described as “quite clever” you rarely need to ask, “When you say ‘quite clever,’ which reference group do you have in mind?”</li>
<li>The next step involves substitution and intensity matching. The evaluation of the flimsy evidence of cognitive ability in childhood is substituted as an answer to the question about her college GPA. Julie will be assigned the same percentile score for her GPA and for her achievements as an early reader.</li>
<li>The question specified that the answer must be on the GPA scale, which requires another intensity-matching operation, from a general impression of Julie’s academic achievements to the GPA that matches the evidence for her talent. The final step is a translation, from an impression of Julie’s relative academic standing to the GPA that corresponds to it.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>“That start-up achieved an outstanding proof of concept, but we shouldn’t expect them to do as well in the future. They are still a long way from the market and there is a lot of room for regression.”</li>
<li>“Our intuitive prediction is very favorable, but it is probably too high. Let’s take into account the strength of our evidence and regress the prediction toward the mean.”</li>
<li>“The investment may be a good idea, even if the best guess is that it will fail. Let&rsquo;s not say we really believe it is the next Google.”</li>
<li>“I read one review of that brand and it was excellent. Still, that could have been a fluke. Let’s consider only the brands that have a large number of reviews and pick the one that looks best.”</li>

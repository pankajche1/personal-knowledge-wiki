Introduction
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
The term <em>utility</em> has had two distinct meanings in its long history. Jeremy
Bentham opened his <em>Introduction to the Principles of Morals and
Legislation</em> with the famous sentence “Nature has placed mankind under
the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. It is for them
alone to point out what we ought to do, as well as to determine what we
shall do.” In an awkward footnote, Bentham apologized for applying the
word <em>utility</em> to these experiences, saying that he had been unable to find a
better word. To distinguish Bentham’s interpretation of the term, I will call it
<em>experienced utility</em>.</p>
<p>
For the last 100 years, economists have used the same word to mean
something else. As economists and decision theorists apply the term, it
means “wantability”—and I have called it <em>decision utility</em>. Expected utility
theory, for example, is entirely about the rules of rationality that should
govern decision utilities; it has nothing at all to say about hedonic
experiences. Of course, the two concepts of utility will coincide if people
want what they will enjoy, and enjoy what they chose for themselves—and
this assumption of coincidence is implicit in the general idea that
economic agents are rational. Rational agents are expected to know their
tastes, both present and future, and they are supposed to make good
decisions that will maximize these interests.</p>

Experienced Utility
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
My fascination with the possible discrepancies between experienced utility and decision utility goes back a long way. While Amos and I were still working on prospect theory, I formulated a puzzle, which went like this: imagine an individual who receives one painful injection every day. There is no adaptation; the pain is the same day to day. Will people attach the same value to reducing the number of planned injections from 20 to 18 as from 6 to 4? Is there any justification for a distinction?</p>
<p>
I did not collect data, because the outcome was evident. You can verify for yourself that you would pay more to reduce the number of injections by a third (from 6 to 4) than by one tenth (from 20 to 18). The decision utility of avoiding two injections is higher in the first case than in the second, and everyone will pay more for the first reduction than for the second. But this difference is absurd. If the pain does not change from day to day, what could justify assigning different utilities to a reduction of the total amount of pain by two injections, depending on the number of previous injections? In the terms we would use today, the puzzle introduced the idea that experienced utility could be measured by the number of injections. It also suggested that, at least in some cases, experienced utility is the criterion by which a decision should be assessed. A decision maker who pays different amounts to achieve the same gain of experienced utility (or be spared the same loss) is making a mistake. You may find this observation obvious, but in decision theory the only basis for judging that a decision is wrong is inconsistency with other preferences. Amos and I discussed the problem but we did not pursue it. Many years later, I returned to it.</p>

Experience and Memory
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
How can experienced utility be measured? How should we answer questions such as “How much pain did Helen suffer during the medical procedure?” or “How much enjoyment did she get from her 20 minutes on the beach?” The British economist Francis Edgeworth speculated about this topic in the nineteenth century and proposed the idea of a “hedonimeter,” an imaginary instrument analogous to the devices used in weather-recording stations, which would measure the level of pleasure or pain that an individual experiences at any moment.</p>
<p>
Experienced utility would vary, much as daily temperature or barometric pressure do, and the results would be plotted as a function of time. The answer to the question of how much pain or pleasure Helen experienced during her medical procedure or vacation would be the “area under the curve.” Time plays a critical role in Edgeworth’s conception. If Helen stays on the beach for 40 minutes instead of 20, and her enjoyment remains as intense, then the total experienced utility of that episode doubles, just as doubling the number of injections makes a course of injections twice as bad. This was Edgeworth’s theory, and we now have a precise understanding of the conditions under which his theory holds.</p>

Biology vs. Rationality
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
The most useful idea in the injections puzzle that preoccupied me years
ago was that the experienced utility of a series of equally painful injections
can be measured, by simply counting the injections. If all injections are
equally aversive, then 20 of them are twice as bad as 10, and a
reduction from 20 to 18 and a reduction from 6 to 4 are equally valuable. If
the decision utility does not correspond to the experienced utility, then
something is wrong with the decision. The same logic played out in the
cold-hand experiment: an episode of pain that lasts 90 seconds is worse
than the first 60 seconds of that episode. If people willingly choose to
endure the longer episode, something is wrong with their decision. In my
early puzzle, the discrepancy between the decision and the experience
originated from diminishing sensitivity: the difference between 18 and 20
is less impressive, and appears to be worth less, than the difference
between 6 and 4 injections. In the cold-hand experiment, the error reflects
two principles of memory: duration neglect and the peak-end rule. The
mechanisms are different but the outcome is the same: a decision that is
not correctly attuned to the experience.</p>
<p>
Decisions that do not produce the best possible experience and
erroneous forecasts of future feelings—both are bad news for believers in
the rationality of choice. The cold-hand study showed that we cannot fully
trust our preferences to reflect our interests, even if they are based on
personal experience, and even if the memory of that experience was laid
down within the last quarter of an hour! Tastes and decisions are shaped
by memories, and the memories can be wrong. The evidence presents a
profound challenge to the idea that humans have consistent preferences
and know how to maximize them, a cornerstone of the rational-agent
model. An inconsistency is built into the design of our minds. We have
strong preferences about the duration of our experiences of pain and
pleasure. We want pain to be brief and pleasure to last. But our memory, a
function of System 1, has evolved to represent the most intense moment of
an episode of pain or pleasure (the peak) and the feelings when the
episode was at its end. A memory that neglects duration will not serve our
preference for long pleasure and short pains.</p>

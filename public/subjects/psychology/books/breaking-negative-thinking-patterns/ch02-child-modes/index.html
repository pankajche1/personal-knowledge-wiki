However, most of us manage to control our childlike behavior in situations in which it would be inappropriate. Child Modes are a way of perceiving the world and other people that resembles the perception of children. Children have difficulty appreciating or adopting other people’s perspective when experiencing strong emotions. An adult in a Child Mode has very similar feelings. Further, when you are in a Child Mode your reactions towards others can resemble the behavior of a child. Like a child, you may find it hard to control your impulses: you may start crying in a conversation with your boss, or you may slam the door in a fight with your partner.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Child Modes are active when we experience strong emotions that are not sufficiently explained by the current situation. When we are in a Child Mode feelings of sadness, anger, shame, or loneliness are exaggerated; it can be very difficult to calm down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Child Modes are typically triggered when we feel rejected, left alone, or put under pressure. In such situations, the fulfillment of basic human needs like closeness, safety, or autonomy seems to be threatened (Box 2.1), even though this may objectively not be the case. Maybe your friend cancelled a date for the movies you had been looking forward to. If you react with a Child Mode, you may feel very disappointed, unloved, abandoned, or angry. From a more adult perspective you may be able to understand your friend’s reasons for cancelling the date and you know that she usually cares a lot about you. Nevertheless, you are overwhelmed with strong feelings, start to cry, or retreat to your bed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Box 2.1: Basic Emotional Needs</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Basic emotional needs are important for all human beings. However, they can differ in their intensity. In schema therapy we assume five categories of basic emotional needs (Young, Klosko, &amp; Weishaar, 2006)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Attachment and safety: You need to feel close to others. The need for attachment comprises safety, stability, attention, love, and acceptance by others.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Independence, competence, and identity: You need to have an idea of what makes you the person you are and what you are good at.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Freedom to express your important needs and feelings.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Spontaneity, fun, and playing.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>Realistic boundaries: It is especially important for children to know their limits and to accept reasonable boundaries set by others.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>People with psychological problems often find it difficult to get these emotional needs met.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People suffering from emotional problems usually experience Child Modes particularly intensely. Small triggers can evoke strong negative feelings, even if the incident is trivial from a more objective perspective. Think of a colleague who did not compliment your new haircut. Most likely your colleague just did not notice or did not care because he was busy. If you have a strong Vulnerable Child Mode, you may feel alone and unloved. In this chapter we will explain why Child Modes show up so easily in some people.</p>
<p><strong>Three types of Child Mode.</strong> The schema therapy model proposes three different types of Child Mode. The <em>Vulnerable Child Mode</em> is associated with depressed or anxious feelings such as shame, loneliness, anxiety, sadness, or threat. The second type is the so-called <em>Angry or Impulsive Child Mode</em>. In this Mode one usually feels rage, anger, impulsivity, or defiance. Impulsive behaviors appear when someone acts out of the moment without considering the possible negative consequences of his or her action. As an example, a man who was criticized by his boss feels angry and hurt: an impulsive ­reaction would be risky driving on the way home. The third type of child Mode is the <em>Happy Child Mode</em>. We regard this as a healthy Mode: one feels curious and playful, and takes easygoing pleasure in games and activities.</p>
<p>If one or more of these Modes sound familiar to you, it might be helpful for you to come up with your own name for it, such as “small Lisa” for the Vulnerable Child Mode or “pigheaded Tom” for the Angry Child Mode. That will help you to make contact with your child Mode when it comes up.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Everybody experiences feelings of sadness and rage from time to time. How can you decide if a child Mode is active and not just “normal” feelings?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Obviously, everyone knows the feelings related to child Modes very well. The significant difference between “normal feelings” and Child Modes is that child Modes are activated by very small incidents. The intensity of negative emotions seems disproportionate to the event. Moreover, it is really hard for a person in a child Mode to control those feelings and the related reactions.</p>

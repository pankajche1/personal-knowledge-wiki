    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Everyone feels or acts like a child sometimes. However, most of us manage to control our childlike behavior in situations in which it would be inappropriate. Child Modes are a way of perceiving the world and other people that resembles the perception of children. Children have difficulty appreciating or adopting other people’s perspective when experiencing strong emotions. An adult in a Child Mode has very similar feelings. Further, when you are in a Child Mode your reactions towards others can resemble the behavior of a child. Like a child, you may find it hard to control your impulses: you may start crying in a conversation with your boss, or you may slam the door in a fight with your partner.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Child Modes are active when we experience strong emotions that are not sufficiently explained by the current situation. When we are in a Child Mode feelings of sadness, anger, shame, or loneliness are exaggerated; it can be very difficult to calm down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Child Modes are typically triggered when we feel rejected, left alone, or put under pressure. In such situations, the fulfillment of basic human needs like closeness, safety, or autonomy seems to be threatened (Box 2.1), even though this may objectively not be the case. Maybe your friend cancelled a date for the movies you had been looking forward to. If you react with a Child Mode, you may feel very disappointed, unloved, abandoned, or angry. From a more adult perspective you may be able to understand your friend’s reasons for cancelling the date and you know that she usually cares a lot about you. Nevertheless, you are overwhelmed with strong feelings, start to cry, or retreat to your bed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Box 2.1: Basic Emotional Needs</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Basic emotional needs are important for all human beings. However, they can differ in their intensity. In schema therapy we assume five categories of basic emotional needs (Young, Klosko, &amp; Weishaar, 2006)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Attachment and safety: You need to feel close to others. The need for attachment comprises safety, stability, attention, love, and acceptance by others.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Independence, competence, and identity: You need to have an idea of what makes you the person you are and what you are good at.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Freedom to express your important needs and feelings.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Spontaneity, fun, and playing.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>Realistic boundaries: It is especially important for children to know their limits and to accept reasonable boundaries set by others.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>People with psychological problems often find it difficult to get these emotional needs met.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People suffering from emotional problems usually experience Child Modes particularly intensely. Small triggers can evoke strong negative feelings, even if the incident is trivial from a more objective perspective. Think of a colleague who did not compliment your new haircut. Most likely your colleague just did not notice or did not care because he was busy. If you have a strong Vulnerable Child Mode, you may feel alone and unloved. In this chapter we will explain why Child Modes show up so easily in some people.</p>
<p><strong>Three types of Child Mode.</strong> The schema therapy model proposes three different types of Child Mode. The <em>Vulnerable Child Mode</em> is associated with depressed or anxious feelings such as shame, loneliness, anxiety, sadness, or threat. The second type is the so-called <em>Angry or Impulsive Child Mode</em>. In this Mode one usually feels rage, anger, impulsivity, or defiance. Impulsive behaviors appear when someone acts out of the moment without considering the possible negative consequences of his or her action. As an example, a man who was criticized by his boss feels angry and hurt: an impulsive ­reaction would be risky driving on the way home. The third type of child Mode is the <em>Happy Child Mode</em>. We regard this as a healthy Mode: one feels curious and playful, and takes easygoing pleasure in games and activities.</p>
<p>If one or more of these Modes sound familiar to you, it might be helpful for you to come up with your own name for it, such as “small Lisa” for the Vulnerable Child Mode or “pigheaded Tom” for the Angry Child Mode. That will help you to make contact with your child Mode when it comes up.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Everybody experiences feelings of sadness and rage from time to time. How can you decide if a child Mode is active and not just “normal” feelings?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Obviously, everyone knows the feelings related to child Modes very well. The significant difference between “normal feelings” and Child Modes is that child Modes are activated by very small incidents. The intensity of negative emotions seems disproportionate to the event. Moreover, it is really hard for a person in a child Mode to control those feelings and the related reactions.</p>

<h2 id="vulnerable-child-modes">Vulnerable Child Modes</h2>
<p>Vulnerable child Modes go along with all types of sad or anxious emotions. Most people can easily name the feeling which troubles them most; the experience of mixed feelings is also ver common. The following examples will give you hints about what to focus on when you wish to get in contact with your own Vulnerable Child Mode. They might also help you understand which situations Vulnerable Child Modes usually appear in. Please keep in mind that the following examples do not aspire to completeness. Your child Mode may be associated with different feelings.</p>
<p><strong>Abandonment or instability.</strong> If you suffer from strong feelings of abandonment, you will often have a sense of being abandoned by others or you fear that you will soon be abandoned. Even in the company of close friends or family members you may happen to experience feelings of loneliness. People with strong feelings of loneliness or abandonment often experienced some kind of desertion in their childhood or youth. Maybe a parent left the family, an important attachment figure died, or they had to live in a succession of foster families that rejected them over and over again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Case Example “Abandonment”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sophia is a 34-year-old middle school teacher. She suffers from anxiety attacks and feelings of dissociation and alienation from her body. These problems occur when she has to return to her own apartment after having spent time with her family at the place where she grew up. She feels lonely and abandoned in such situations, even though she has friends in the place where she lives. She tells her therapist that she does not feel close to other people and that all her relationships seem to her to be superficial. When discussing these issues she suddenly feels very sad and gets the feeling that no one will ever stay with her. The therapist suggests that this could be related to Sophia’s repeated loss of a mother figure: her birth mother died when she was 2 years old, and her beloved stepmother died unexpectedly from a cerebral hemorrhage when Sophia was 16.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Social isolation.</strong> Some people lack the feeling of belonging to others. They feel isolated, as if they were cut off from the rest of the world. The origin of this feeling is very often an experience of being excluded, for example, by frequent moving or by membership in an unusual, restrictive religious community. Early exclusion from the family or the group of siblings can be traumatic as well. In adult life, seemingly unimportant social signals, such as the order of seating at a dinner party, can trigger the Mode of the excluded child.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Case Example “Isolation”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Megan moved a lot with her family when she was a child. She had always been the “new girl,” didn’t belong to her changing peer groups, and felt excluded. Today she attends university and has found some good friends. But when her fellow students make plans without explicitly including her, she readily feels excluded even when that is objectively not the case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mistrust and abuse.</strong> Mistrust goes along with a feeling of constant threat. You are always alert to signs of threat and have a suspicious attitude towards other people. People suffering from severe feelings of mistrust are always on their guard, sensing a need to avoid harm by other people. As with the emotions described above, the origin of mistrust most often lies in problematic childhood experiences. A woman who has been sexually abused as a child may become panicky merely from the sound of keys in the door. As another example, think of someone who was bullied on his way to school. As an adult this person cannot stand it if someone walks closely behind him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Case Example “Mistrust and abuse”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Astrid is very frightened of the dark. She always sleeps with the light on. When her husband is not at home she usually stays at a friend’s place overnight. As soon as she notices an unfamiliar noise outside, her body stiffens and she gets panicky. Every shadow on the street makes her feel anxious and helpless. As a child she suffered from the violent temper of her father. He used to hit her and her brothers and sisters randomly if something upset him. Her mother couldn’t protect her as the father also beat her.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Defectiveness and shame.</strong> Shame is another possible dominant feeling of a Vulnerable Child Mode. Often feelings of being deficient, bad, inferior, or unwanted are linked. You feel as if you are not worth the love, attention, and respect of others. Instead you may feel horribly ashamed of the way you are. People with these feelings have frequently been the victims of devaluing comments or humiliating treatment in their childhood or adolescence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Case Example “Defectiveness and Shame”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Daniel’s teacher in high school had a few favorite students. Daniel was not one of them. He was very insecure during puberty because he had grown very fast and often felt awkward and behaved clumsily. This teacher repeatedly exposed him to ridicule when he stumbled or behaved awkwardly in any other way. The ensuing laughter of his classmates was extremely humiliating for Daniel. Twenty years later he is a successful IT counselor. On one occasion he accidentally stumbled over the flip chart in a meeting and his colleagues started laughing. Immediately Daniel felt rising feelings of shame and helplessness and escaped to the toilet where it took him several minutes to calm down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Emotional deprivation.</strong> People suffering from emotional deprivation usually feel that their childhood was “on the whole, all right.” But somehow they still did not get the feeling of really being cared for and loved. They lack security, closeness, and attachment. As adults they do not necessarily report constant emotional distress. They do not really miss anything. Still they feel like they don’t matter for other people, and this is a painful experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Case Example “Emotional Deprivation”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Steven is a 38-year-old sales marketer who likes his job and fulfills it to his bosses’ satisfaction. His marriage is happy and he also has some friends. Still he can’t get rid of the feeling of never being close to others and loved by them. He tries really hard to get proof of affection from others, both in his job and in his private life. Although there are plenty of people who do like him and let him know it, he can hardly ever feel their affection. Steven says that his childhood was “all right.” His parents were always very busy and often absent. He often felt that it was too much for his parents to take care of their children on top of everything else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Dependency or incompetence.</strong> When you feel unable to do anything independently and do not dare to decide things by yourself, you behave like a dependent child. For children it is normal to depend on parents for important decisions, such as the choice of their school. But if your parents did not stimulate you to make your own choices, even if at times they had different preferences than you did, you may remain dependent on other people. You may not even know what your preferences are. In adult life you still think that your parents or your partner are responsible for your life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Case Example “Dependency and Incompetence”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Marjorie lived with her parents till the age of 24, when she married Bob. He has a full-time job and she does the housekeeping. She always worked in her parents’ shop, and she doesn’t dare to look for another job. She lives near her parents and visits them every day. She asks her parents or Bob for advice about everything. She asks her mother what she should eat, how to decorate her house, and even how to dress. All the other decisions she leaves to Bob.</p>

<p>By reading the case examples you might already have got an idea of what a Vulnerable Child Mode can feel like. The following points will help you to check whether you have a Vulnerable Child Mode as well. If you agree quite strongly with one of the statements, this might be the first clue. If you agree only weakly, you probably know these feelings but they don’t cause you serious distress.</p>
<ul>
<li>I often feel completely alone.</li>
<li>I feel weak and helpless.</li>
<li>I have the feeling that no one loves me.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you agree with one or more of these statements? If you often feel sad, abandoned, or anxious without a particular reason it’s probably because of a Vulnerable Child Mode. Very often there is a link between this Mode and your personal history.</p>
<p>If you want to get to know your Vulnerable Child Mode more closely, the following questions may be helpful. You can also use Worksheet 2, “My Vulnerable Child Mode”:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are common triggers for my Vulnerable Child Mode? Which ­situations does it appear in?</li>
<li>What feelings do I experience in this Mode?</li>
<li>What thoughts typically come up when I am in this Mode?</li>
<li>What memories or mental images are associated with my Vulnerable Child Mode?</li>
<li>How does my body feel in this Mode?</li>
<li>How I do I typically act in this Mode? How do I treat other people?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you try to be aware of your Vulnerable Child Mode in your everyday life, you will soon understand it much better. You’ll learn what makes it turn up over and over again. You may use Worksheet 1, your “Mode overview worksheet” to fill in these points.</p>

<p><strong>Worksheet 2: My Vulnerable Child Mode</strong></p>
<p>My name for this Mode (e.g. Little Lisa):</p>
<p>(1) How can I realize that my Vulnerable Child Mode is present?</p>
<p>What is <strong>triggering</strong> my vulnerable child Mode?</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>What <strong>feelings</strong> do I usually have in this Mode?</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>What <strong>thoughts</strong> tend to come up in this Mode?</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>What <strong>memories</strong> are associated/get triggered?</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>How does my <strong>body</strong> feel in this Mode?</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>(3) What are my actual needs when I am in the Vulnerable Child Mode?</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>(4) Are my needs met by my behavior (e.g. need for closeness)?</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<h3 id="detecting-vulnerable-child-modes-in-others">Detecting Vulnerable Child Modes in others</h3>
<p>When you sense that somebody feels very easily frightened, threatened, unstable, or is close to tears, this hints at a vulnerable Child Mode in that person. Another sign can be a constant urge for reassurance, for example, “Are you really sure that you want me to join you and your friends tonight?” Another clear indicator for a Vulnerable Child Mode is black and white thinking, where the world is split into two parts – good and bad. For example, your friend is convinced that you are completely on her partner’s side in a conflict after you made a small critical remark on her behavior.</p>
<p>Do you remember any situation in which one of your friends, family members, or colleagues seemed to be in a Vulnerable Child Mode? Do you understand what made him or her switch into that Mode? How did he or she behave in the Vulnerable Child Mode? Do you have a clue on the ­person’s needs in that situation? How did you feel yourself towards that person, and how did you react?</p>
<p>Maybe you felt compassionate and were able to show it. It is also possible that you felt overstrained, helpless, or irritated because arguments and consolidation didn’t seem to help. If you remember your own feelings or reactions towards this person, it makes it easier for you to understand how other people feel when you are in your Vulnerable Child Mode.</p>

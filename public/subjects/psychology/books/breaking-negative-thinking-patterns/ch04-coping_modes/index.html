<p>In the previous chapters dealing with Dysfunctional Child and Parent Modes we explained how people develop hurtful inner elements when they experience abuse or rejection during childhood and adolescence. Everyone has some experience of such Child and Parent Modes, even if only to a limited extent. Some people manage to feel well despite such experiences because these dysfunctional elements are not very strong or tend to be triggered only rarely. However, people who are afflicted with strong Modes of these types will run into emotional problems over and over again.</p>
<p>Whether you experience these Modes frequently or rarely you’ll be aware that human beings differ in their ability to deal with difficult emotional experiences. Many psychologists call the processes by which people address these difficulties “coping styles.” A coping style is kind of psychological survival strategy to deal with threatening emotions and experiences. Coping styles differ from person to person: just like emotions, coping styles are often influenced by childhood experiences. The intensity of Coping Modes most often depends on the strength of the related Dysfunctional Child and Parent Modes.</p>
<p><strong>Three Coping Modes.</strong> In general, therapists differentiate between the following three Coping Modes, although they often overlap:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Surrendering.</strong> In this coping style you surrender to the Punitive, Critical or Guilt-inducing Parent Mode and start thinking negatively about yourself, and feeling bad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoidance.</strong> In this coping style you avoid emotions and problems and so you don’t have to be confronted with them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Overcompensation.</strong> In this coping style you act in the opposite way to the feelings and demands of your Dysfunctional Parent Modes. You may display excessive self-confidence or seek to control other people in order to avoid feelings of insecurity or helplessness.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this chapter you will learn more about these three coping styles. As a first step we will give you an overview on how to distinguish them.</p>

Figure 4.1: Surrendering</p>
<p><strong>Surrendering.</strong> We talk about surrendering when a person behaves as if the messages from their Dysfunctional Parent and Child Modes are absolutely true. They do not see how to “escape” from difficult situations in a healthy way. So they start feeling bad, sad, miserable or guilty, or even mad at themselves. When they are asked to express their own needs, they may feel helpless and avoid doing so.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Case Examples “Surrendering”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>As a child, Holly experienced sexual abuse by her grandfather. Her grandmother was aware of the abuse, but did not dare to raise her voice against her husband. Later in life, Holly gives in to the sexual desires of any man who wants her. When a man wants to find out what she actually wants herself, she cannot say and feels horribly insecure.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Joshua has a strong Guilt-inducing Parent Mode. It has its origin in his depressed mother, who frequently asked him for support when he was a child. Nowadays, Joshua is a social worker who sacrifices himself for his clients and often overburdens himself. He is always willing to care about their problems even when his working hours are over and even though his boss has asked him to set stricter limits in his dealings with clients. In his private life he does everything to make his girlfriend happy and completely forgets to take care of himself. When his girlfriend wants to do something nice for him, he can hardly feel his own inner needs.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Nora has a strong demanding parent side forcing her to do everything perfectly. She works day and night. If she takes even a short rest she always feels the pressure to start doing something useful. She is perpetually afraid of being a failure. She surrenders to her achievement oriented demanding parent side.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

Figure 4.2: Avoidance</p>
<p><strong>Avoidance.</strong> People often avoid distressing emotions related to Dysfunctional Child or Parent Modes by avoiding certain situations or by consuming sedating substances like alcohol or benzodiazepine. We talk about someone employing an avoidant style of coping when they act to put a distance between themselves and a difficult emotional experience. Note that we only talk of a Coping Mode when the reaction is dysfunctional, i.e. by showing this reaction the person fails to care for their own needs or ­fulfill their usual obligations.</p>
<p>Avoidant patterns can be related to very different actions, including avoidant behavior in a narrow sense (e.g. social retreat or not attending work), use of emotionally numbing substances (alcohol, cannabis, benzos, etc.), or other distracting behaviors (e.g., eating to cope with feelings; excessive consumption of TV or video games). In people with severe mental ­disorders, different symptoms can be related to Avoidant Coping. For ­instance, starving oneself (anorectic symptoms) reduces emotional experiences; some patients with borderline personality disorder injure themselves to escape strong negative emotions, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Case Examples “Avoidance”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Isabella has a strong Punitive Parent Mode telling her that nobody likes her and that she is ugly. Since she was a little child she has been teased about her knock-knees and her acne. Her family used to compare her unfavorably to her pretty sister. As a result she feels ashamed when she is around other people. She avoids these feelings mainly by social retreat (avoidant behavior). When she does go out, she usually drinks much more alcohol than she actually wants, probably because when she is drunk she feels less ashamed and anxious.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Jake was a very good high school student. His family was strongly oriented towards achievement and he developed a strong Demanding Parent Mode. At university he suddenly found himself as merely one of many talented students, struggling with the same difficulties as everybody else. He can no longer always satisfy his Demanding Parent Mode by being the best. As time goes by he draws back from the university. Instead he spends his time playing “World of Warcraft” and other video games, surfing the Internet, and watching TV. All these can be considered avoidant behaviors to escape his feelings of failure.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Catherine has a strong Guilt-inducing Parent Mode telling her that she is responsible for everything and has to support everybody. She has often helped her neighbor with various issues. Though Catherine likes to help her, the neighbor, who is a very lonely woman, clings to Catherine. She’d love to talk for several hours a day, which is way too much… Catherine, however, is simply unable to set limits to the neighbor’s demands. Instead, she has taken to looking through the spyhole in her door to check whether the “coast is clear” – her neighbor is not around – before leaving the apartment. Catherine knows that she should set clearer limits to her neighbor’s excessive demands. However, the pressure of her Guilt-inducing Parent Mode is too strong, so she avoids encounters with the woman.</li>
</ol>

Figure 4.3: Overcompensation</p>
<p><strong>Overcompensation.</strong> Overcompensation means that someone confronts a deficit with an excess. We talk about an overcompensating coping style when someone behaves as if the opposite of their Vulnerable Child and Dysfunctional Parent Modes’ messages were true. For example, someone who is feeling inferior to others might overcompensate by behaving excessively self-confidently or even arrogantly. Or a man who feels insecure with women starts behaving like a macho. Someone who feels helpless may try to be very controlling with others.</p>
<p>Just like avoidance, overcompensation can take many forms. What they all have in common is that the overcompensating person seeks to control and dominate the situation. Everyone else gets the feeling that it’s impossible to go against the wishes and opinions of the overcompensating person.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Case Examples “Overcompensation”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Ruby experienced physical and sexual violence when she was a child. Nowadays, when somebody merely holds another opinion than herself, she tends to feel threatened and helpless. She overcompensates for these feelings with a very aggressive set of behaviors: she gets loud and screams at others, trying to intimidate them. She does this even when it is completely inappropriate. She feels that only aggressive behavior will enable her to get her needs met.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Carl is a small, plump, rather unattractive man who grew up in a rich family of entrepreneurs. However, the family company went into bankruptcy some years ago, so his wealth is gone. He’s always felt inferior because of his unattractive appearance. This feeling has been enhanced by the loss of his money. He compensates for his feelings of inferiority by behaving in an extremely self-confident and macho way. Most other people can see straight away that he actually feels inferior and is compensating by showing off.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Benjamin was forced by his father to stay in his room for hours to do his homework. He started to resist his father and they frequently had arguments. Eventually, he stopped doing his homework, took to missing classes, and started using cannabis and cocaine – later, even heroin. He was kicked out of school. His father became very frustrated and disappointed in him. Benjamin didn’t finish his education and became an addict.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He used drugs not only to feel better but actually to resist his father’s demands. Using drugs has given him the feeling that he controls his father by doing the opposite of what his father actually wants. He has developed a narcissistic personality disorder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that it is important for all of us to be able to cope with negative emotions when they overwhelm us. Coping strategies help us to survive difficult emotions and situations. Psychoanalysts call coping styles “defense mechanisms” and assume that every healthy individual needs them. Thus, emotional avoidance can be useful from time to time. Think of conflicts which can never come to a good solution – for example an annoying neighbor whose cats frequently foul your lawn. You will come across an annoying neighbor no matter where you live, so moving might not be the solution… What you should rather try to do is avoid angry feelings, because you may not be able to come to a solution and the issue is actually not so very important to you. You might as well just invest in a shovel and some cat repellent, and ignore your neighbor.</p>
<p>A coping style becomes a Dysfunctional Coping Mode when it stands in the way of you getting your needs met. For example if you try to avoid all types of conflict – not only with your annoying neighbor, but also with your significant others, such as your friends or your partner – you will not be able to address your own needs in your interactions with these important people, and in the long run the relationships will not develop in the way you need them to.</p>
<p>Maybe you have already picked up a feeling for your typical coping style(s) from your reading of the case examples. It is fairly normal for a person to use different coping styles in different situations. Someone with a strong Guilt-inducing Parent Mode, for example, may cope for a long time by surrendering and trying to care for everyone’s needs. However, when this strategy becomes too much to bear they might switch to coping by avoiding and start to shun social situations. Alternatively, they might activate an overcompensating coping style and push back harshly on people who make even the smallest demand.</p>
<p>Coping patterns develop differently in childhood and adolescence. Usually, Coping Modes develop unconsciously to “survive” difficult situations. A particular coping style was probably the best way to protect yourself from difficulties, rejection or threat, when you were a child or adolescent. It was only later in your life that it became a Dysfunctional Mode. We often learn Coping Modes from role models: we observe how another person reacts to problematic situations or feelings. Think of a family with a verbally abusive father and a mother who does not set limits and does not protect her children, but instead surrenders to the father. These children in their turn have a high risk of developing a surrendering coping style in the face of aggression.</p>
<p>As always, different pathways may act together in the development of Coping Modes. When a child feels threatened by its father and observes its mother surrendering, it sees a surrendering role model. This will make the child feel even less safe, since the mother does not offer protection. The feeling of being exposed to danger increases the child’s motivation to develop Coping Modes of its own.</p>
<h3 id="41-compliant-surrender-mode">4.1 Compliant Surrender Mode</h3>
<p>When someone is in a Surrendering Coping Mode they care about the needs of others and not at all about their own. They allow others to treat them badly. They do things they actually do not want to do because others want or demand it – even though from an objective point of view they are not obliged to do so. They accede to the wishes of others in private, sexual, or other relationships, even though their own wishes are different.</p>
<p>Often, these people sense that they are actually not happy or satisfied with the way that they behave. But sometime they may actually use additional strategies associated with Avoidant Coping to keep the Surrender Mode going. For example a woman surrendering in sexual relationships may drink alcohol because getting drunk before sex is easier for her than setting a healthy limit, or saying “No.”</p>
<p>Now, take a moment to think about the times that you give in to the demands of others, even if they are not congruent with your own needs and feelings. Do you experience situations in which you do things that you actually don’t want to do and aren’t obliged to do? What feelings drive you in these situations? What are you afraid of that stops you setting limits? Do you have an idea about the origin of this behavior? When and why you did develop this Mode?</p>
<p>You may add your own examples to Worksheet 9, “My Surrendering Coping Mode.” It can help you to detect pros and cons of your surrendering and develop ideas for alternative behaviors.</p>
<p>Sometimes, so-called dependent relationship patterns are linked to the Compliant Surrender Coping Mode. People with strong interpersonal dependency will not take responsibility for their own life. Instead, they always need someone to take care of them and make decisions for them. Only then do they feel safe. Interpersonal dependency is linked with surrendering coping, since dependent people are willing to give up a lot to make sure that they have someone to take responsibility for them.</p>

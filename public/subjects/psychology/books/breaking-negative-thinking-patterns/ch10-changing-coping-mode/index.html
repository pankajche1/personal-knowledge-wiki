    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>As with all other Modes, the important first step is to understand your Coping Modes thoroughly. The best way to do this is to think hard about your thoughts, feelings, and actions and to ask trustworthy people for their views on the way you seem to cope. The trustworthy people might include your therapist but might just be your friends, your partner, your siblings, or your favorite colleagues. Moreover, you should reflect on feedback you’ve previously had. Have other people, for example. noticed and commented that you’ve got a habit of trying to get around important things (Avoidant Coping Mode)? Or have you been asked repeatedly why you let other people treat you badly, or why you tolerate unbearable situations (Compliant Surrender Coping Mode)? Have you been accused of being arrogant or too aggressive (Overcompensating Coping Mode)? Comments of this kind are a precious source of information about your Coping Modes. Since we often feel quite well when we are in a Coping Mode, neutral observers are sometimes better than we are ourselves at detecting our typical coping behaviors. However, that will change once you’ve come to understand your Coping Modes; then it will be much easier for you to identify the Coping Mode you just “slipped into.”</p>
<p><strong>Identify:</strong> The Coping mode you &lsquo;slip&rsquo; into:</p>
<ol>
<li>Avoidant Coping Mode</li>
<li>Compliant Surrender Coping Mode</li>
<li>Overcompensating Coping Mode</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="get-in-touch-with-your-coping-modes">Get in Touch with your Coping Modes</h3>
<p>The following questions will help you determine your Coping Modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>What kind of feedback do you get from friends or colleagues?</li>
<li>Do people from different life contexts (e.g. work, leisure, family) notice similar behavior patterns in you?</li>
<li>How do you react to emotional distress, e.g. conflicts in your relationships or at work?</li>
<li>Which coping styles from Chapter 4 did you recognize in yourself?</li>
<li>Go to your friends, your partner, or other people to you and ask them directly which coping style they associate with you. They’ll probably have good reasons for their opinions – but maybe they’ll never tell you unless you ask.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that Surrendering and Avoidant Coping behaviors are relatively easy to detect. People with these coping styles often sense clearly that they have emotional difficulties in dealing with certain situations. Things are different for overcompensation. When you are stuck in an overcompensatory Mode, showing off or attacking others, you may feel really strong and well in yourself. Negative feelings are pushed aside. People around you can see, maybe even see through, your behavior but don’t dare to confront you. Therefore, it is often difficult to gain insight into your own overcompensation. An imagery exercise (Exercise 10.1) can be helpful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Exercise 10.1</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This imagery exercise can be helpful when you are not sure about the origin of a surrendering or some other coping style.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Close your eyes and go back to a situation in which your Coping Mode was active. Put yourself into this situation in your imagination: What are you doing? How does your voice sound? What do you say? How do you feel? How does your body feel?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Once you’ve got in touch with the situation, build an <strong>affective bridge</strong> into your childhood memories. Let your mind wander into your childhood and adolescence. Do you see any images with your inner eye? What people, situations, feelings, and needs are related to these images? Get a feeling for the biographical situation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Finish the exercise by reflecting on the connections between your feelings today and your childhood memories. What did you learn with the exercise? What questions are still unanswered?</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="102-reducing-coping-modes">10.2 Reducing Coping Modes</h3>
<p>The main goal here is to modify, in fact, to weaken, your Coping Modes in a way that stops them standing in your way when you’re trying to meet your needs. It’s important to keep in mind that every Coping Mode has a purpose, and a sensible degree of coping is actually quite healthy. For example, in the midst of some desperate conflict at your workplace it’s good to keep some emotional distance and to be able to switch on some level of Avoidant Coping. Coping Modes become problematic when they cause harm in your life, because you can’t manage to get out of them even if you want to.</p>
<p><strong>Look at the pros and cons of your coping.</strong> Work out the advantages and disadvantages of your Coping Mode. First, try to get some feeling of when your Coping Mode causes problems and when it is actually useful. A pro–con list can be really helpful here. A pro–con list consists of two columns. The left is the “pro side”: in this column you write down all the advantages of your Coping Mode. The right is the “con side”: here you put all its disadvantages.</p>
<p>You may remember Harry, the insecure student of economics (Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2), and you have just been reading and thinking about Glenn. In the following box you will find the pro–con list for Harry’s Avoidant Coping Mode and for Glenn’s Overcompensation Mode (see 4.3.). Look at these lists and then use Worksheet 16, “Pros and cons of my Coping Mode” to check your own Coping Mode. Very often you find it’s short-term advantages on the pro side and long term problems on the con side (problematic behaviors).</p>

<p>A basic principle of the Mode concept is that everyone experience themselves differently at different moments. While you may feel very healthy and relaxed in one moment, you may feel vulnerable and sad in another. In some other situation you may rather be emotionally cold and feel nothing. Such different states are called “Modes.” In schema therapy we define the following Modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Vulnerable and Angry Child Modes.</strong> Most people are familiar with feelings of weakness, inferiority, sadness or intense rage, defiance or anger, in which they do not feel grown up. In schema therapy such states are called “Child Modes.” We call them Child Modes because we assume that when important needs are not met in someone’s childhood, they will have emotional parts that cannot grow up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dysfunctional Parent Modes.</strong> People with intense Child Modes often tend to devalue themselves or to put excessive pressure upon themselves. These Modes are called Dysfunctional Parent Modes, as they have often been “modeled” by devaluing or abusive parents, or bullying class mates
or siblings. The term parent in Parent Modes does not only relate to real parents, but also to any other important maladaptive attachment figure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Coping Modes.</strong> When someone is affected by negative feelings they tend to use one or more favored strategies to reduce those feelings or to hide them from others. The technical term for such psychological “survival strategies” is “Coping Mode.” Such coping includes avoidant behaviors like social retreat or cannabis use in order to calm down negative feelings. Another way of coping with negative feelings is to behave aggressively or excessively self-confidently when actually feeling weak or inferior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Healthy Adult Mode.</strong> Of course we do not only have dysfunctional or immature modes: we also have healthy parts with high-level functioning, healthy connections with other people, and positive emotions. The part that is able to organize your life, solve problems and take care of good relationships is called the “Healthy Adult Mode.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Happy Child Mode.</strong> All people – both children and adults – have a need for fun, happiness and easiness. The Happy Child Mode is related to these feelings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="recognizing-your-modes">Recognizing your Modes</h4>
<p>The first part of this book is all about becoming familiar with your Modes. It will describe and explain all the Modes. It includes many examples illustrating how to detect Modes in yourself and in others. We will find out how strong the different Modes are in your life. How did they develop in your life and why are some Modes more significant than others? We will focus on how your Modes make you feel and what type of situations cause them to pop up.</p>
<h3 id="changing-your-modes">Changing your Modes</h3>
<p>In the second part of the book you will learn strategies and exercises which can help you to change your Modes. The general aim is to enable you to cope with difficult situations in the way that suits you. You’ll get to know your own needs better and learn how to fulfill them. These exercises and changes are related to three different levels of human experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Thoughts (Cognitive level).</strong> On the cognitive level it’s most relevant to learn everything about your Modes and to reflect on the appropriateness of the cognitions related to your Modes. On this level you also work out realistic plans about what you want to change. Protocols and worksheets will guide and help you with this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feelings (Emotional level).</strong> You will find many suggestions on how to change distressing emotions. Imagery exercises are powerful emotional techniques. In these exercises you imagine yourself in a certain situation, and think about what you need and what you want to change. Next, you imagine that you behave in a certain way to change the situation. The influence of this exercise on emotions is much stronger than merely thinking about the same issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Behaviors (Behavioral level).</strong> Behavior changes usually follow work with cognitions and emotions. The book will offer many examples and suggestions on how to change persistent behavior patterns in your life.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, every person is unique, and your Modes differ from other people’s. You will take different things out of this book than someone else will. Maybe you just want to get some information about schema therapy. Or maybe you want to try to find out how the Mode perspective applies to you. Maybe you suffer from an emotional problem, or you’ve been thinking about changing the way you behave in certain situations. You’ll find several worksheets in the book which should help you in working out your Modes. But please be aware that this book is not a replacement for the psychotherapy you may need if you suffer from a serious mental illness!</p>
<p>We hope that this book will help you find out more about yourself and your Modes. Have fun on your “inner journey”!</p>

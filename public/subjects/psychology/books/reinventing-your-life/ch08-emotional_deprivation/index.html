<blockquote>
<p><strong>Jed:</strong> Thirty-nine years old. Women always disappoint him emotionally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two things struck us about Jed as he walked into our office for the first time. One was how handsome he looked, and the other was how cold. There was a remote quality to him that was difficult to pierce in therapy. But in that first session he sat down and told us why he was there.</p>
<p>He had been through a series of relationships with women, starting when he was a teenager, but none had lasted longer than six months. The pattern was always the same. Each time he started a relationship, he felt a sense of hope and excitement. He believed that, at last, this was the woman for whom he had been looking so long. Despite his initial strong attraction, inevitably the relationship ended in disappointment. Jed  expressed his frustration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>JED: <em>And now, it&rsquo;s happened again with Elaine. I was sure it was going to be different this time. It was so good at first. But just like with all the others, after a while I started to get bored and dissatisfied. She began to irritate me.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>What did Elaine do that made you angry?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>JED: <em>Everything she did made me angry. She didn&rsquo;t return my phone calls fast enough, she talked to other people too much at parties, she spent too much time with her friends, she spent too much time at work, she didn&rsquo;t give me an expensive enough birthday present. But mainly she just wasn&rsquo;t exciting enough. You know, I know she loved me. But she just wasn&rsquo;t enough. I needed more.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the beginning of Jed&rsquo;s love relationships, the chemistry he feels is strong. But he gradually loses his passionate feelings until only a sense of disappointment remains. It is soon after this that the relationship ends.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dustin:</strong> Twenty-eight years old. He falls in love with unavailable women.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>DUSTIN: <em>The same thing keeps happening. I fall madly in love with someone. For some reason, it can&rsquo;t work out. Like this. (He begins to list on
his fingers.) Anne was married, Jessica and Melinda both had other boyfriends who didn &rsquo;t know about me, Lisa lived too far away, and Gail had just broken up with someone else and wasn&rsquo;t ready to jump into another serious relationship.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dustin&rsquo;s lovers are usually a certain personality type. He is attracted to women who are cold and aloof: &ldquo;When I meet a woman who is warm and giving, I seem to lose interest quickly.&rdquo; The women who keep Dustin&rsquo;s interest, indeed the women with whom he becomes obsessed, are  narcissistic, self-centered, and expect much but give little in return. Although they might find it gratifying to be with Dustin because he is so attentive, they seldom want to form a close relationship, and never make a commitment.</p>
<p>Dustin&rsquo;s relationships are stormy. He goes through ecstasies and agonies. As he grows more angry and frustrated, gradually the woman begins to dislike spending time with him. Finally the relationship ends. Dustin goes through a period of dejection until the whole process starts again with the next woman.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Elizabeth:</strong> Forty years old. Emotionally giving to others, BUT MARRIED TO A MAN WHO CANNOT GIVE TO HER.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elizabeth and Josh have been married for five years. They have a baby boy. Elizabeth is a warm and nurturant mother. In fact, she tends to spoil her son. She finds it painful to hear the sound of his crying, and rushes to fill even his slightest demands.</p>
<p>Josh is an executive in a large corporation. He works long hours and travels all over the world. Elizabeth spends many nights and weekends home alone with the baby: &ldquo;Even when Josh is home, it is not much better. He&rsquo;s preoccupied with his work and seems uninterested in spending time with me.&rdquo; Elizabeth suspects that he is unfaithful to her on his business trips. She is in a constant state of anger. On the rare occasions that they are together, she spends most of the time complaining and reproaching him. Ironically, her anger just serves to push Josh further away.</p>
<p>Jed, Dustin, and Elizabeth all have the Emotional Deprivation lifetrap. If you have this lifetrap, you have a deep and fixed belief that your needs for love will never be met.</p>
<p><strong>THE EMOTIONAL DEPRIVATION QUESTIONNAIRE</strong></p>
<p>The questionnaire below will help you decide how strongly you have this lifetrap. Rate each item using the following scale:</p>
<p><strong>Scoring Key</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Completely untrue of me</li>
<li>Mostly untrue of me</li>
<li>Slightly more true than untrue of me</li>
<li>Moderately true of me</li>
<li>Mostly true of me</li>
<li>Describes me perfectly</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have any 5&rsquo;s or 6&rsquo;s on this questionnaire, this lifetrap may still apply to you even if your score is in the low range.</p>
<ol>
<li>I need more love than I get.</li>
<li>No one really understands me.</li>
<li>I am often attracted to cold partners who can&rsquo;t meet my needs.</li>
<li>I feel disconnected, even from the people who are closest to me.</li>
<li>I have not had one special person I love who wants to share him/herself with me and cares deeply about what happens to me.</li>
<li>No one is there to give me warmth, holding, and affection.</li>
<li>I do not have someone who really listens and is tuned into my true needs and feelings.</li>
<li>It is hard for me to let people guide or protect me, even though it is what I want inside.</li>
<li>It is hard for me to let people love me.</li>
<li>I am lonely a lot of the time.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>YOUR TOTAL EMOTIONAL DEPRIVATION SCORE:</strong> _______</p>
<p>Interpreting Your Emotional Deprivation Score</p>
<p>10-19 Very low. This lifetrap probably does not apply to you. <br>
20-29 Fairly low. This lifetrap may only apply occasionally. <br>
30-39 Moderate. This lifetrap is an issue in your life. <br>
40-49 High. This is definitely an important lifetrap for you. <br>
50-60 Very high. This is definitely one of your core lifetraps.</p>
<p>THE EXPERIENCE OF EMOTIONAL DEPRIVATION</p>
<p>The experience of emotional deprivation is harder to define than some of the other lifetraps. Often it is not crystallized into thoughts. This is because the original deprivation began so early, before you had the words to describe it. Your experience of emotional deprivation is much more the sense that you are going to be lonely forever, that certain things are never going to be fulfilled for you, that you will never be heard, never be understood.</p>
<p>Emotional deprivation feels like something is missing. It is a feeling of emptiness. Perhaps the image that most captures its meaning is that of a neglected child. Emotional deprivation is what a neglected child feels. It is a feeling of aloneness, of nobody there. It is a sad and heavy sense of knowledge that you are destined to be alone.</p>
<p>When Jed first came into therapy, he could not really tell us what was disturbing him. At first he said things like, &ldquo;I feel alone,&rdquo; &ldquo;I feel detached.&rdquo; Later he told us that he has experienced such intense feelings of loneliness and disconnection that he has considered suicide.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>JED: <em>I am emotionally dead. My lack of intimacy with women applies to all my relationships. Vm not close to anyone, not to any family members, not to friends.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Jed the world is an emotional desert. His only respite from isolation is in the very early stages of his relationships with women. And, as we have noted, these are short-lived.</p>
<p>Some people with this lifetrap show a tendency to be demanding in relationships. There is an insatiable quality to the lifetrap. No matter how
much people give you, it never feels like enough. Ask yourself, &ldquo;Do people keep telling me that I am too needy, or that I ask for too much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jed is an example. Elaine arranged an elaborate birthday party for him at great effort and expense. Nevertheless, when he opened her present at the party, Jed felt a sharp pang of disappointment: &ldquo;The one I gave her was much more expensive.&rdquo; It is this persistent feeling of deprivation in the face of clear evidence of caring that marks the person with an Emotional Deprivation lifetrap.</p>
<p>One way Elizabeth expressed her lifetrap was by choosing a field of work that involved meeting the needs of other people. She became a social worker. Perhaps you are in one of the healing or helping professions. Giving nurturance to others may be a way for you to compensate for your own feelings of unmet emotional needs. Similarly, you might exert great effort toward meeting the needs of your friends. Elizabeth said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ELIZABETH: <em>I am always the listener. Other people tell me their problems, and I help them as best I can, but I don&rsquo;t tell anyone my problems. I
guess that&rsquo;s why I came to see you. I understand people better than they understand me, or care to understand.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, it is a sign of the Emotional Deprivation lifetrap to feel chronically disappointed in other people. People let you down. We are not speaking about a single case of disappointment, but rather a pattern of experiences over a long period of time. If your conclusion as a result of all your relationships is that you cannot count on people to be there for you emotionally—that is a sign that you have the lifetrap.</p>
<p>THE ORIGINS OF EMOTIONAL DEPRIVATION</p>
<p>The origins of emotional deprivation lie in the person who serves as the maternal figure for the child—the person who is chiefly responsible for giving the child emotional nurturance. In some families this figure is a man, but in our culture it is usually a woman. The father figure is important also, but in the first years of life, it is usually the mother who forms the center of the child&rsquo;s world. That first relationship becomes the prototype for those that follow. For the rest of the individual&rsquo;s life, most close relationships will bear the stamp of that first experience with mother.</p>
<p>With emotional deprivation, the child received a less than average amount of maternal nurturance. The term nurturance has a number of dimensions, as you can see from the table below outlining the origins of this lifetrap. We use the word mother to refer to the maternal figure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Origins of Emotional Deprivation</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Mother is cold and unaffectionate. She does not hold and rock the child enough.</li>
<li>The child does not have a sense of being loved and valued—of being someone who is precious and special.</li>
<li>Mother does not give the child enough time and attention.</li>
<li>The mother is not really tuned into the child&rsquo;s needs. She has difficulty empathizing with the child&rsquo;s world. She does not really connect with the child.</li>
<li>Mother does not soothe the child adequately. The child, then, may I not learn to soothe him/herself or to accept soothing from others.</li>
<li>The parents do not adequately guide the child or provide a sense of direction. There is no one solid for the child to rely upon.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Jed&rsquo;s deprivation was severe. He was almost totally neglected. Jed&rsquo;s mother was seventeen when she became pregnant. His father was much older and
married, and refused to acknowledge Jed as his son. His mother had hoped that once Jed was born, his father would relent and assume his place beside her. This is not what happened, however.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>JED: <em>My father showed no more interest in her after I was born than he had shown before. As soon as she realized I was useless as bait to win him back, she lost all interest in me. She expected her life to return immediately to normal, so she could resume dating rich older men. She really never should have had me.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We often hear phrases like these from patients with Emotional Deprivation: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why she had me,&rdquo; or &ldquo;They never should have had me.&rdquo; Jed remembers from the time he was very young, having no one to take care of him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>JED: <em>Most of the time she wasn&rsquo;t around. But even when she was with me it was no different. Whenever J wanted something from her, she would say, &ldquo;Be quiet, go to sleep, you need a nap,&rdquo; and go on with what she was doing as if I wasn&rsquo;t there.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Elizabeth, the deprivation was more subtle. Her mother was a responsible person and would not neglect her child. However, like Jed&rsquo;s mother, she was narcissistic. Instead of viewing her child as a separate person with needs of her own, she viewed her child as an extension of herself. She saw Elizabeth as an object, to be used for her own gratification.</p>
<p>What Elizabeth&rsquo;s mother wanted, what she had failed to achieve in her own life, was to be rich. She wanted Elizabeth to marry a rich man.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ELIZABETH: <em>She taught me to be pretty and charming. It was the price of her love. She taught me to perform for company. She took me shopping. She dressed me up like a doll. But when we were done shopping and the company was gone, she ignored me. I just wasn&rsquo;t relevant anymore.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we know, Elizabeth grew up to fulfill her mother&rsquo;s wishes. She married a rich man. Now she is the executive&rsquo;s wife. He expects her to be pretty and charming for company. When the company is gone, he ignores her.</p>
<p>Dustin, the man who keeps falling in love with unavailable women, seemingly had a good mother. She did all the right things. She gave Dustin the best toys, the best clothes, the best schools, the best vacations. Yet there was a sense of coldness. Dustin&rsquo;s mother was a successful lawyer. She had built a career at a time when it was a rarity to find women working in the professions. She focused her attention almost exclusively on her work. At home she was self-absorbed and withdrawn.</p>
<p>Although she did not admit it to herself, in her heart she regarded Dustin as a nuisance, as a demanding child who distracted her from matters of true importance. And she was simply not a warm woman. She had difficulty showing affection, even to people whom she appreciated more than Dustin. Secretly, she blamed Dustin for the low intensity of her feelings toward him. It was not her fault that he aroused so little love.</p>
<p>Dustin grew up with a core of grief over the absence of a nurturing mother. He covered his grief with a hard shell of anger. This is an example of the Counterattacking coping style we discussed in Chapter 4. On the surface, he seemed very much the spoiled, petulant boy.</p>
<p>Now, as an adult, Dustin reenacts his Emotional Deprivation lifetrap in his numerous romantic relationships with unavailable women. He pursues one doomed relationship after another. Inevitably, each woman frustrates him and he becomes increasingly demanding. It always ends with the woman breaking his heart.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DUSTIN: <em>Before I started therapy I really had no idea I was caught in this process. Each time I thought I just happened to fall in love with a woman who just happened to be unavailable.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although his mother was emotionally depriving, Dustin was fortunate in one respect. He had a loving father. If not for the relationship with his father, Dustin might have sealed himself off forever from intimate human contact. The love Dustin&rsquo;s father gave him partly healed the damage done by his mother, so that the lifetrap developed in a more limited way. He was able to form other healthy relationships outside the family.</p>
<p>Dustin&rsquo;s lifetrap has a restricted range in his adult life. He does not view <em>everyone</em> as depriving—only the women with whom he falls in love. Dustin has satisfying relationships with many people. He has many good friends, both male and female, to whom he pours out the misery of his stormy love affairs.</p>
<p>Dustin&rsquo;s case illustrates the important role the father plays in the child&rsquo;s early life. If a child has an emotionally depriving mother, but a father who is not depriving, the father can become a bright spot in the child&rsquo;s otherwise dark psychic life. The father&rsquo;s love can serve as partial remediation of the child&rsquo;s emotional deprivation. If the child is lucky, the father will sense the inadequacy of the mother and assume a greater portion of responsibility for providing nurturance. As Dustin said, &ldquo;My father helped me keep hope in the world.&rdquo; Similarly, children who have a depriving father but a mother who is not depriving, may reenact their emotional deprivation as adults in certain relationships but not in others. For example, girls with depriving fathers may reenact this lifetrap in love affairs with men, but not so much in other types of relationships.</p>
<p>It sometimes takes us a while to realize that a patient has the  Emotional Deprivation lifetrap. Unlike most of the other lifetraps, where the parent does something <em>active</em> that damages the child, emotional deprivation results from the <em>absence</em> of certain mothering behaviors. Behaviors of the parent such as the criticalness that gives rise to the Defectiveness lifetrap, or the domination that gives rise to Subjugation, are highly visible. The parent commits actions the child can remember. But emotional deprivation is not always like this. Emotional deprivation is something missing, something the child never knew.</p>
<p>Emotional deprivation, therefore, can be a difficult lifetrap for you to recognize. Unless you experienced extreme neglect, it might take some exploration to determine whether you were deprived as a child. You might recognize the lifetrap in yourself only after you have asked yourself specific questions: &ldquo;Did I feel close to my mother, did I feel she understood me, did I feel loved, did I love her, was she warm and affectionate, could I tell her what I felt, could she give me what I needed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In therapy, many people with the Emotional Deprivation lifetrap at first say things like, &ldquo;Oh, I had a normal childhood. My mother was always there.&rdquo; Dustin began therapy saying, &ldquo;My mother gave me everything. I had everything I wanted.&rdquo; However, when people with this lifetrap describe their past and current relationships, something is wrong. A disturbing pattern emerges. There is a feeling of disconnection. Perhaps the person is hypersensitive to being deprived or is chronically angry. It is only when we work our way backwards that we understand the origin. Although Emotional Deprivation is one of the most common lifetraps, it is often one of the hardest to detect.</p>
<p>ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS</p>
<p>In our culture, it is romantic relationships that are usually the most intimate. For this reason, some people who have the Emotional Deprivation lifetrap avoid romantic relationships altogether, or only get into them for a short time. This is typical of the Escape coping style. However, if you are willing to become involved in romantic relationships and do not simply remain alone, it is probably in these relationships that your lifetrap is most visible.</p>
<p>Perhaps you, like Jed, have a history of breaking off relationships when the person starts to get too close. You conveniently find reasons to end the relationship. Or, like Dustin, you protect yourself from closeness by choosing partners who are unavailable. Or, like Elizabeth, you choose someone who is there, but is cold and ungiving. No matter what path you take, the final outcome is the same. You wind up in a situation that is
emotionally depriving, thus replicating your childhood deprivation.</p>
<p>The next table lists some of the danger signals to avoid in the early stages of dating. They are signals that you are about to repeat the pattern again and become involved with someone who is emotionally depriving.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Danger Signals in the Early Stages of Dating</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>He/She doesn&rsquo;t listen to me.</li>
<li>He/She does all the talking.</li>
<li>He/She is not comfortable touching or kissing me.</li>
<li>He/She is only sporadically available.</li>
<li>He/She is cold and aloof.</li>
<li>You are much more interested in getting close than he/she is.</li>
<li>The person is not there for you when you feel vulnerable.</li>
<li>The less available he/she is, the more obsessed you become.</li>
<li>He/She does not understand your feelings.</li>
<li>You are giving much more than you are getting.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>When several of these signals are occurring at once, run—particularly if the chemistry is very strong. Your lifetrap has been triggered full force.</p>
<p>We know it will be hard for you to take this advice. All your yearning will be directed toward staying in the relationship. This is what happened to Dustin. Dustin began dating Christine in the course of therapy. Christine was beautiful; she was a successful model in New York City. Dustin was just one of a throng of men who pursued her. Although he knew the affair was doomed, he could not stop himself. His lifetrap fought for the relationship&rsquo;s survival. We watched the whole process spin itself out, from the height of Christine spending the weekend with him at his country house, to the depth of her final refusal to see him or to return his increasingly desperate phone calls.</p>
<p>Even if you choose an appropriate partner who is emotionally giving, there are still pitfalls to avoid as your relationship progresses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Emotional Deprivation Lifetraps in a Relationship</p>
<ol>
<li>You don&rsquo;t tell your partner what you need, then feel disappointed when your needs are not met.</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t tell your partner how you feel, and then feel disappointed when you are not understood.</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t allow yourself to be vulnerable, so that your partner can protect or guide you.</li>
<li>You feel deprived, but you don&rsquo;t say anything. You harbor resentment.</li>
<li>You become angry and demanding.</li>
<li>You constantly accuse your partner of not caring enough about you.</li>
<li>You become distant and unreachable.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>You might reinforce your deprivation by sabotaging the relationship. You might become hypersensitive to signs of neglect. You might expect your lover to read your mind and almost magically to fill your needs. Although, as we will discuss next, some people who have the lifetrap Counterattack by becoming demanding in relationships, most do not ask for what they want. It probably does not occur to you to spell out your needs. Most likely you do not ask for what you want, and then become very hurt, withdrawn, or angry when your emotional needs are not met.</p>
<p>DEMANDINGNESS IN RELATIONSHIPS</p>
<p>Some people with the Emotional Deprivation lifetrap counterattack; they compensate for their feelings of deprivation by becoming hostile and demanding. These people are <em>narcissistic</em>. They act as if they are entitled to get all their needs met. They demand a lot, and often get a lot, from the people who become their lovers.</p>
<p>Jed is like this. Regardless of how much nurturing he receives from a woman, he still feels that his needs are not being met. However, instead of acting hurt or rejected about not getting enough, he becomes <em>angry</em>. This is very different from Elizabeth, who is also hypersensitive to emotional slights, but instead remains <em>silent</em> about her needs. Jed and Elizabeth illustrate two different styles of coping with Emotional Deprivation: Jed&rsquo;s anger and demandingness are typical of the Counterattack coping style, while Elizabeth&rsquo;s silence is characteristic of Surrender as a way of coping.</p>
<p>Why do some people react to Emotional Deprivation by becoming narcissistic? The answer lies in a combination of the Emotional Deprivation lifetrap and the Entitlement lifetrap. Although as children their <em>emotional</em> needs were not met in important ways, narcissists have learned to fight the feelings of deprivation by becoming very demanding about other, more <em>superficial</em> needs.</p>
<p>For example, you might be very demanding about what you eat, or how you dress, or whom you are with, or where you go. You might be very demanding about <em>material</em> things. You might be demanding about anything except the true object of your craving, which is emotional nurturance. Unfortunately, these material demands are ultimately a poor substitute for love and understanding, and so you are not satisfied. You go on craving tangible rewards, never addressing the underlying issue, and are never satisfied.</p>
<p>As a child, you were not allowed to be demanding about emotional needs. Your mother (probably) did not respond. But if she allowed you to be demanding about other needs, it was at least a way for you to get <em>something</em>. This is what happened to Dustin. Although Dustin&rsquo;s mother was cold, she was excellent at filling other types of needs. She was lavish with material gifts, so Dustin developed a sense of entitlement about material things. Unlike Dustin, some children are neglected in both domains, emotionally and materially. No matter where they turn, they encounter deprivation. These children usually just give up and learn to expect nothing (the Surrender coping style).</p>
<p>There is an <em>inauthentic</em> quality to a relationship with a narcissist. Intimate encounters, even with the people they are closest to, remain superficial. If this is you, at some level you feel a sense of despair at the shallowness of your relationships. It is because you are so seldom demanding about the needs that are most pressing, the primary emotional needs, that your encounters strike a note of falseness.</p>
<p>The following list outlines the steps to change the Emotional Deprivation lifetrap:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Changing Emotional Deprivation</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Understand your childhood deprivation. Feel the deprived child inside of you.</li>
<li>Monitor your feelings of deprivation in your current relationships. Get in touch with your needs for nurturance, empathy, and guidance.</li>
<li>Review past relationships, and clarify the patterns that recur. List the pitfalls to avoid from now on.</li>
<li>Avoid cold partners who generate high chemistry.</li>
<li>When you find a partner who is emotionally generous, give the relationship a chance to work. Ask for what you want. Share your vulnerability with your partner.</li>
<li>Stop blaming your partner and demanding that your needs be met.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us explore each step in more detail.</p>
<p><strong>(1) Understand Your Childhood Deprivation. Feel the Deprived Child Inside of You</strong>. Understanding is always the first step. You must come to terms with the truth of what happened to you as a child. As we have noted, with Emotional Deprivation this can be more difficult than with some of the other lifetraps. You may not even know that you were deprived. <br>
Jed knew when he came to therapy that he had been deprived. Such blatant deprivation is easily recognized. Even early in therapy Jed was able to generate images of his neglect—of being the only child without a mother present at countless occasions, from receiving a Cub Scout medal all the way to his high school and college graduations. He remembered forging his mother&rsquo;s signature on his report cards because she could not bother to sign them. <br>
Jed could easily access his anger about the deprivation, but he had difficulty accessing the pain (typical of Counterattackers). Elizabeth, on the other hand, was in touch with the pain, with how lonely she felt as a child (typical of Surrenderers). It was harder for her to access the anger. You have both anger and grief about your deprivation. As we shall see, it is important to try to feel both. <br>
For Dustin and Elizabeth, understanding the past was more difficult. They were uncovering a more subtle process. Actually, we believe that there are three distinct types of emotional deprivation. Breaking it down this way may help you to clarify exactly what it was that happened to you as a child. You may have been deprived in one or two of these areas but not the others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Three Kinds of Emotional Deprivation</p>
<ol>
<li>Deprivation of Nurturance</li>
<li>Deprivation of Empathy</li>
<li>Deprivation of Protection</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Each kind of deprivation refers to a different aspect of love. Nurturance refers to warmth, attention, and physical affection. Did your parents hold and rock you? Did they comfort and soothe you? Did they spend time with you? Do they hug and kiss you when you see them now? <br>
Empathy refers to having someone who understands your world and validates your feelings. Did your parents understand you? Were they in sync with your feelings? Could you confide in them when you had problems? Were they interested in listening to what you had to say? Would they discuss their own feelings with you if you asked them to? Could they communicate with you?</p>
<p>TODO</p>
<p><strong>(2) Monitor Your Feelings of Deprivation Now. Get in Touch with Your Needs for Nurturance, Empathy, and Guidance.</strong></p>
<p>Become more aware of your feelings of deprivation in your current life. Teach yourself to notice when your lifetrap is triggered. It might be a time that you feel slighted, lonely, or empty, or that no one understands how you feel. You might feel sad that your lover is unavailable, or cold and ungiving. You might feel angry that you always have to be the strong one, that you are always the one who takes care of your partner, and it is never the other way around. Any strong feeling of deprivation can serve as a cue that your lifetrap is triggered and that you should pay attention to what is going on.</p>
<p>It is important that you allow yourself to feel all the emotions that get triggered along with your lifetrap. Try not to block any feelings. Explore the whole spectrum of emotions, as fully as you can.</p>
<p>You can use imagery to connect even further with your feelings. When some event in your current life provokes strong feelings of deprivation, relive the experience again through imagery. Allow all your feelings to emerge. Get in touch with your needs for nurturance, empathy, and protection. Then connect the image to an image in the past when you were a child and felt the same way. If you repeatedly alternate between the present and the past in this manner, you will be able to deepen your awareness of the ways you reenact your childhood deprivation in your current relationships.</p>
<p>Dustin did this imagery exercise in a therapy session with us. He was describing an incident with Christine that had upset him greatly. They had already broken up and had run into each other at a party. We asked Dustin to get an image of Christine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>What do you see?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>DUSTIN: <em>I see Christine. She&rsquo;s there in the middle of the image, dressed in white—like she was in that magazine ad. She looks frozen and perfect. She&rsquo;s surrounded by glass.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>Where are you?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>DUSTIN: <em>I&rsquo;m outside the glass. I&rsquo;m trying to tell her something, but she can&rsquo;t hear me through the glass. I can&rsquo;t get her to look at me. I&rsquo;m waving my arms and I&rsquo;m yelling, but she can&rsquo;t hear me through the glass.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>Tell me what you&rsquo;re feeling.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>DUSTIN: <em>I&rsquo;m alone.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We then asked Dustin to get an image of when he felt this way before, as a child. The memory that came was of his mother: &ldquo;I see her sitting on the couch reading, and I&rsquo;m walking on the other side of the room very quietly because I know she&rsquo;d be annoyed if I disturbed her while she was reading her book.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>(3) Review Your Past Relationships. Clarify the Patterns That Keep Repeating. List the Pitfalls to Avoid from Now On.</strong></p>
<p>Make a list of the most important relationships in your life. You may want to focus on romantic relationships, or you may want to focus on family or close friends. Think about what went wrong with each relationship. Was the person unable or unwilling to meet your needs? Did you drive him/her away with your incessant demands, which, when filled, never made a difference anyway? Did you grow bored with someone who was treating you well? Were you in fact getting more from the relationship than you acknowledged at the time?</p>
<p>It was in making this list that Dustin&rsquo;s pattern became glaringly obvious to him. He clearly saw that, with each woman that he had been attracted to, there were clues from the beginning that she was emotionally unavailable in some important way. Of course, in each case, he had ignored these early warning signs. It was painful for him to recognize in therapy that his most powerful love relationships had been doomed from the start.</p>
<p>The pattern that emerged from the list Elizabeth made was that she gave a lot to each person, but got little in return. And for Jed, it was that he had been dissatisfied with every woman, regardless of what she gave him. In his characteristic blaming way, he said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a list of women who were one disappointment after another.&rdquo; What is the unifying principle of your list? What are the pitfalls for you to avoid?</p>
<p><strong>(4) Avoid Cold Partners Who Generate High Chemistry.</strong></p>
<p>This is that simple rule that is so hard to follow. <em>Do not get involved with depriving partners</em>. The rule is so hard to follow because these are precisely the partners who attract you the most. We often give patients this rule-of-thumb: If you meet someone for whom you feel a high degree of chemistry, rate how much chemistry on a 0 to 10 scale. If you rate the person a 9 or 10, then <em>think twice about becoming involved with this person</em>. Occasionally, such relationships work out, after a great deal of turmoil. But, more often, the strong  chemistry you feel will be based on lifetraps that they trigger in you, rather than positive qualities that will make the relationship last.</p>
<p>We are not saying that you have to settle for spending the rest of your life with a partner who only generates a response of 0-5 in you. We feel
that there has to be <em>some</em> chemistry for the relationship to work. But, if there is <em>only</em> romantic chemistry, it almost certainly will not work in the long run. There are plenty of 6&rsquo;s, 7&rsquo;s, and 8&rsquo;s out there. One of them might bring you the deep fulfillment of an intimate, loving relationship, perhaps for the first time in your life.</p>

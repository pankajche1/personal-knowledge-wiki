<blockquote>
<p><strong>Alison:</strong> Thirty years old. She feels unworthy of love.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alison looks frightened when she walks into our office. It is obvious she is uncomfortable talking about herself. We try to put her at ease. After a while, we ask her why she has come. She tells us she is depressed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>ALISON:</strong> I guess I get down on myself a lot. I am always thinking, &ldquo;Why would anyone want to be with me?&rdquo; Like there&rsquo;s this guy I&rsquo;ve gone out with for a few months. Almost a year actually. His name is Matthew. The other day I called him and left a message on his machine. Waiting for him to call back, I kept thinking, &ldquo;I know he won&rsquo;t call, he doesn&rsquo;t want to see me anymore. &ldquo;Like he&rsquo;s found me out or something. It&rsquo;s like I keep waiting for the moment that he finds me out. And even when he called back, the whole time I kept thinking, &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t want to talk to me, he wants to get off the phone.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>THERAPIST:</strong> It&rsquo;s hard for you to believe that he really cares.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we talk more, we realize that Alison is considering marrying Matthew: &ldquo;He asked me to marry him a few weeks ago. He&rsquo;s really good to me. I know I&rsquo;d be crazy not to marry him.&rdquo; But for some unaccountable reason she finds herself frightened at the idea of marriage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>ALISON:</strong> Maybe I just haven&rsquo;t had too many good relationships. The last guy I thought about marrying was not exactly the nicest guy in the world. In fact he was emotionally abusive. He was on my back about something all the time.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>THERAPIST:</strong> But it doesn&rsquo;t sound like Matthew is like that. Just the opposite.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>ALISON:</strong> No, I know. It&rsquo;s something different. I think I&rsquo;m just afraid to let anyone get close to me. And Matthew&rsquo;s a person who is trying to  get close to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that is why Alison has come to therapy. She is having a &ldquo;crisis of intimacy.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Eliot:</strong> Forty-three years old. He comes to therapy with his wife for marital problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our first impression of Eliot is one of tight self-control. Throughout the session, we glimpse a kind of cold anger underneath. Eliot has come to therapy with his wife, Maria, to focus on marital problems.</p>
<p>Eliot and Maria have been married for seven years and have one child. Maria has just found out that Eliot has been having an affair. She  threatened to leave the marriage unless he agreed to come to therapy. In that first session, he told us, &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t think that / need to be here,&rdquo; and &ldquo;If you ask me, she&rsquo;s the one who has problems.&rdquo; It is almost as if he expected us to work with him to solve her problems.</p>
<p>Throughout the session, Eliot is critical of Maria and critical of us. It is difficult to connect with him. He keeps a distance. After we explain lifetrap therapy to them, he says, &ldquo;It sounds incredibly simple-minded,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Is that all there is to this therapy?&rdquo; We know he is testing us, and we tell him so. &ldquo;You want to make sure we can handle you.&rdquo; He wants to see if he can put us one-down—if he can make us defensive. When he sees that
he cannot, we gain some of his respect.</p>
<p>Although we are feeling irritated, we remain empathic. We know that, underneath, Eliot is frightened of us. He is afraid we can see through him.</p>
<h3 id="the-defectiveness-questionnaire">THE DEFECTIVENESS QUESTIONNAIRE</h3>
<p>This questionnaire will measure the strength of your Defectiveness lifetrap. Use this scale to answer each of the items:</p>
<p><strong>Scoring Key</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Completely untrue of me</li>
<li>Mostly untrue of me</li>
<li>Slightly more true than untrue of me</li>
<li>Moderately true of me</li>
<li>Mostly true of me</li>
<li>Describes me perfectly</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have any 5&rsquo;s or 6&rsquo;s on this questionnaire, this lifetrap may still apply to you, even if your score is in the low range.</p>
<ol>
<li>No man or woman could love me if he/she really knew me.</li>
<li>I am inherently flawed and defective. I am unworthy of love.</li>
<li>I have secrets that I do not want to share, even with the people closest to me.</li>
<li>It was my fault that my parents could not love me.</li>
<li>I hide the real me. The real me is unacceptable. The self I show is a false self.</li>
<li>I am often drawn to people—parents, friends, and lovers—who are critical and reject me.</li>
<li>I am often critical and rejecting myself, especially of people who seem to love me.</li>
<li>I devalue my positive qualities.</li>
<li>I live with a great deal of shame about myself.</li>
<li>One of my greatest fears is that my faults will be exposed.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>YOUR TOTAL DEFECTIVENESS SCORE</strong> = ?</p>
<p><strong>Interpreting Your Defectiveness Score</strong></p>
<p>10-19 Very low. This lifetrap probably does not apply to you.</p>
<p>20-29 Fairly low. This lifetrap may only apply occasionally.</p>
<p>30-39 Moderate. This lifetrap is an issue in your life.</p>
<p>40-49 High. This is definitely an important lifetrap for you.</p>
<p>50-60 Very high. This is definitely one of your core lifetraps.</p>
<h3 id="the-experience-of-defectiveness">THE EXPERIENCE OF DEFECTIVENESS</h3>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What emotion is most connected to the Defectiveness? <br>
<strong>Ans:</strong> Shame is the emotion that is most connected to defectiveness.</p>
<p>The emotion that is most connected to the Defectiveness lifetrap is shame. Shame is what you feel when your defects are exposed. You will do almost anything to avoid this feeling of shame. Consequently you go to great lengths to keep your defectiveness hidden.</p>
<p>You feel that your defectiveness is inside you. It is not immediately observable. Rather, it is something in the essence of your being—you feel completely unworthy of love. In contrast to the Social Exclusion lifetrap, which concerns superficial or observable characteristics, Defectiveness is an inner state. While we usually know fairly quickly whether someone has a Social Exclusion lifetrap, Defectiveness is not so obvious. Certainly it is one of the most common lifetraps, but it is often hard to detect. Because your imagined defect is internal—unseen—you suffer even more from the terror of being exposed.</p>
<p>Almost half our patients have Defectiveness as one of their primary lifetraps. However, on the surface, these patients look very different. Each
copes with feelings of shame in different ways. Some lack confidence and look insecure (Surrender). Some look normal (Escape). And some look so
good you would never believe they had the lifetrap (Counterattack). Alison is an example of someone who surrenders to her sense of defectiveness. She is in touch with feelings of being inherently flawed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>ALISON:</strong> I have always felt there is something wrong with me, deep inside where no one can see. And that I would live my whole life without
anyone loving me.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>THERAPIST:</strong> When you think of someone loving you, how does it feel?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>ALISON:</strong> It makes me cringe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>cringe = to feel embarrassed, to move away from somebody/something because you are frightened</p>
<p>Alison feels that there is something about her—some secret—which, if known, would make her utterly unacceptable. She cannot say what that secret is.</p>
<p>There is a strong sense that, whatever Alison&rsquo;s secret is, she believes she cannot change it. It is what she is, her very being. The best she can do is hide it, and try to postpone the inevitable moment when someone gets close enough to find out.</p>
<p>Alison believes strongly that no one could possibly care about her. She constantly discounts evidence that people like her and want to be with her.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ALISON: I told Matthew that I didn&rsquo;t want to go to his brother&rsquo;s wedding.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: Why did you do that? I thought you wanted to go.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ALISON: Yes, but I knew Matthew didn&rsquo;t really want me to go.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: Didn&rsquo;t he ask you?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ALISON: Yes, but I just knew he really didn&rsquo;t want me there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She also magnifies evidence that people dislike and reject her, even with us; she tries to twist what we say to imply we do not really care about her.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: We wanted to ask you if we could switch your session time next week to an hour earlier.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ALISON: Do you mean you don&rsquo;t want to have our session? If you don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s okay. I mean, if there&rsquo;s something you have to do.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: No, not at all. Of course we want to have our session. We just want to know if it&rsquo;s possible for you to move it back an hour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alison is very self-punitive. At various times we have heard her say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no good,&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a jerk,&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m worthless,&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m good-for-nothing,&rdquo; &ldquo;I have nothing to offer.&rdquo; At the beginning of therapy, her thinking was filled with put-downs of herself. And there were a few extremely painful moments in therapy when her self-criticism rose to self-hatred. At these moments, she experienced herself as &ldquo;a vile, disgusting person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alison&rsquo;s Defectiveness lifetrap makes her much too vulnerable in relationships. The other person has so much power to hurt her. She does not protect herself or defend herself. Eliot is at the opposite end of the spectrum. He has a quality of <em>invulnerability</em>. No one can touch him. He has developed the Counterattacking style of coping so effectively that most people never suspect; in fact, Eliot himself is largely unaware of his own deep feelings of shame.</p>
<p>self-punitive =  acting or serving to punish oneself</p>
<p>Eliot is an example of a fragile narcissist. A narcissist is someone who lacks empathy, blames others for problems, and has a strong sense of <em>entitlement</em>. People like Eliot have developed this narcissism to fight back against their underlying feelings that no one will ever love or respect them. It is as if they are saying to the world: &ldquo;I will be so demanding, act so superior, and become so special that you will never be able to ignore or criticize me again.&rdquo; (This is an example of the Counterattack coping style we describe in Chapter 4. You can read more about narcissism and how it can be changed, in the chapter on Entitlement.)</p>
<p>Narcissists will hold onto their self-centeredness at almost all costs. Eliot was watching his marriage to a woman he loved deeply disintegrate, yet he was unable to admit that he had problems. He would rather lose everything than risk making himself vulnerable. This is often the case. Until their backs are against the wall, narcissists will not change. As with Eliot, the threat of abandonment is one thing that can sometimes motivate a narcissist to change.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MARIA: No matter how much he hurt me, no matter how much pain I was in, it didn&rsquo;t make any difference. I could cry a thousand tears, and he would keep seeing that woman. It was only when he saw I was really leaving that he agreed to stop seeing her.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eliot and Maria both have the Defectiveness lifetrap. He counterattacks his underlying shame through narcissism, while she surrenders to her sense of worthlessness. He rejects her, and she is the victim of rejection. Together they reenact their original drama of rejection by the parent.</p>
<p>If you have the Defectiveness lifetrap, you probably lie somewhere between the two extremes represented by Alison and Eliot. Perhaps you allow yourself to be quite vulnerable in some areas but not in others. We have many patients like this. They come in very willing to talk about their lives, but when certain topics arise, they skirt the issue. These topics make them feel ashamed or defective.</p>
<p>It is relatively unusual for patients to come in knowing that they feel defective. Most patients mask or avoid these feelings in some way because it is so painful to experience the extraordinary self-hatred and shame connected with this lifetrap. Without realizing it, people strive to keep themselves unaware of their feelings of shame. They come to therapy complaining of other things, of relationship problems or depression.</p>
<p>You may experience a chronic, vague unhappiness without being able to explain why. You do not realize that your depression is a function of your negative view of yourself. Feeling unworthy and angry at yourself is a large part of depression. You may feel that you have been depressed your
whole life—a kind of low-level depression lurking in the background.</p>
<p>If your primary coping style is Escape, you may have addictions or compulsions. Drinking, drugs, overworking, and overeating are all ways of numbing yourself to avoid the pain of feeling worthless.</p>
<p><strong>The Origins of the Defectiveness Lifetrap</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Someone in your family was extremely critical, demeaning, or punitive toward you. You were repeatedly criticized or punished for how you looked, how you behaved, or what you said.</li>
<li>You were made to feel like a disappointment by a parent.</li>
<li>You were rejected or unloved by one or both of your parents.</li>
<li>You were sexually, physically, or emotionally abused by a family member.</li>
<li>You were blamed all the time for things that went wrong in your family.</li>
<li>Your parent told you repeatedly that you were bad, worthless, or good-for-nothing.</li>
<li>You were repeatedly compared in an unfavorable way with your brothers or sisters, or they were preferred over you.</li>
<li>One of your parents left home, and you blamed yourself.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Defectiveness lifetrap comes from feeling unlovable or not respected as a child. You were repeatedly rejected or criticized by one or both of your parents.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ALISON: I once read this book that said that the purpose of a woman&rsquo;s life was to inspire fove. It always struck me that that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been unable to do. Inspire fove.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Defectiveness is a global feeling. It is the sense of being unworthy of love. You felt so flawed or inadequate that even your parent could not love you or value you for who you are.</p>
<p>You almost certainly felt that your parent was right to criticize you, devalue you, reject you, or not give you love. You felt that you deserved
it. As a child, you blamed yourself. Everything happened because you were so worthless, inadequate, flawed, and defective. For this reason, you
probably did not feel angry about the way you were treated. Rather, you felt ashamed and sad.</p>
<p>Alison&rsquo;s lifetrap is largely the result of her father&rsquo;s criticalness. He made it clear very early that she was a disappointment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ALISON: I just wasn&rsquo;t what he wanted in any way, really. I felt that everything about me was wrong. We used to sit at the dinner table, and,
when I was quiet, he would criticize me for not talking; when I talked, he would tell me how boring I was.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She incorporated her father&rsquo;s criticalness. Her father&rsquo;s view of her became her view of herself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ALISON: I just keep thinking, why would Matthew want to marry me? I have nothing to offer. I&rsquo;m so immature. I just don&rsquo;t have what it takes to keep a man interested. I&rsquo;m not particularly special in any way. My looks are mediocre, my mind is mediocre. I don&rsquo;t have a great personality.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: Whose voice is this? Whose voice is it in your head that&rsquo;s saying all this?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ALISON: Well, it&rsquo;s Eric. My old boyfriend.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: Is it anyone else?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ALISON: (Pause.) It&rsquo;s my father&rsquo;s voice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like Alison, you internalized the voice of your critical parent and it became part of you. In a sense, the voice of your critical parent is your lifetrap—this voice that constantly criticizes, punishes, and rejects you in your mind.</p>
<p>Shame may have dominated your childhood. Each time your defectiveness was exposed, you felt ashamed. This shame cut deep. It was not about superficial things. Rather it was about who you were.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ALISON: I remember when I was a teenager, I once spent the whole afternoon reading up on this political event, it was Watergate I think, just so I could talk about it at dinner. And, when I opened my mouth, he said, &ldquo;Is that all you can think to say about it?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: What did you feel?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ALISON: I felt so ashamed that I tried to be interesting, and that I failed so abysmally.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: Yes, like you were exposed as wanting to be something you could never be.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ALISON: What was that?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: Loved by him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We might ask why Alison&rsquo;s father was so cold and rejecting. One strong possibility is that he had a Defectiveness lifetrap himself. However, he coped with his lifetrap by Counterattacking. He made himself feel better by putting Alison down and making her feel that she was the defective one. He scapegoated her. Perhaps in Alison he saw a reflection of his own defectiveness. We feel this is often the case. Many times it seems that the parents have defectiveness issues themselves, which they pass along to their children. This is how the lifetrap is passed down through the
generations.</p>
<p>Parents who give rise to the Defectiveness lifetrap are usually punitive and critical. There may be physical, emotional, or sexual abuse.  Defectiveness and Abuse often go hand-in-hand. While it is possible for a child who is abused to feel that it is unfair and to be angry without feeling defective, this is seldom the case. Far more often, the child accepts responsibility. The child feels guilt and shame.</p>
<p>Many children find some way to make up for their feelings of defectiveness. This is where the lifetrap starts to blend with Entitlement and Unrelenting Standards. Many people who have grown up being criticized and made to feel defective compensate by trying to be superior in some area. They set high standards and strive for success and status. They may act arrogant and entitled. With money and recognition, they try to allay
that inner feeling of defectiveness.</p>
<p>This is what happened to Eliot. On the surface, he looks very much like a success. He is the owner of a popular nightclub frequented by stars. Each night he walks through the club bestowing favors on important people. He decides who gets a table, who gets free drinks, who gets an invitation to the V.I.P. room. He tells stories with obvious glee about denying special favors to celebrities. However, the defective feeling is still there underneath.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ELIOT: Only one person has ever made me squirm at my club. That was [a popular male movie star]. He pranced in, acting like he owned the place,
and I decided to put him in his place. I showed him to this really mediocre table. As I walked away, I looked at him, and he was giving me this look. Man, it was a withering glance.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: What did you feel at that moment?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ELIOT: I felt like he could see right through me. Like I wasn&rsquo;t fooling him one bit. Like I was an impostor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sense that it all might collapse is always with Eliot. This is the fragility of his narcissism. His persona can collapse, suddenly exposing the worthless person he believes he is underneath.</p>
<p>TODO: many paragraphs</p>
<p>Jobs that require public speaking may be a particular problem for you. You feel exposed. Public speaking anxiety is particularly common among people with Defectiveness lifetraps. The sense is that somehow people will see through you. Perhaps, through your anxiety symptoms—sweating, shaking, your voice cracking—they will sense your defectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Changing Your Defectiveness Lifetrap</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Understand your childhood feelings of defectiveness and shame. Feel the wounded child within you.</li>
<li>List signs that you might be coping with Defectiveness through Escape or Counterattack (i.e., avoiding or compensating).</li>
<li>Try to stop these behaviors designed to Escape or Counterattack.</li>
<li>Monitor your feelings of defectiveness and shame.</li>
<li>List the men/women who have attracted you most and the ones who have attracted you least.</li>
<li>List your defects and assets as a child and teenager. Then list your current defects and assets.</li>
<li>Evaluate the seriousness of your current defects.</li>
<li>Start a program to change the defects that are changeable.</li>
<li>Write a letter to your critical parent(s).</li>
<li>Write a flashcard for yourself.</li>
<li>Try to be more genuine in close relationships.</li>
<li>Accept love from the people close to you.</li>
<li>Stop allowing people to treat you badly.</li>
<li>If you are in a relationship where you are the critical partner, try to stop putting your partner down. Do the same in other close relationships.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we take the above one by one:</p>
<p><strong>(1) Understand Your Childhood Defectiveness and Shame. Feel the Wounded Child Within You.</strong></p>
<p>The first step is to re-experience your early feelings of defectiveness and shame. Where did the lifetrap come from? Who criticized and shamed you? Who made you feel invalid and unloved? Was it your mother? father? brother? sister? The answer almost certainly lies in your early family life.</p>
<p>Try to remember as much as possible about specific events. You can use photographs to help you. You can return to familiar places from your childhood, and you can utilize imagery.</p>
<p>When you have some time to yourself, sit in a darkened room in a comfortable chair. Close your eyes and let images of your childhood come. Do not force them. Just let them float to the surface of your mind. If you need somewhere to begin, start with something in your current life that triggers a feeling of defectiveness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ALISON: I remember when I was little, maybe about seven, my uncle put a $50,000 bond in my name. Of course, he really did it for my mother, but somehow at the time I was confused and thought he did it for me. Because he liked me or something. I remember being really  embarrassed to see him after I found out,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: Can you get an image of it?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ALISON: (Closes eyes.) I see myself in my room. Vm getting dressed. My mother has just told me that we&rsquo;re going to my uncle&rsquo;s house. Vm getting dressed really carefully. I want to look good for my uncle. When I finally come out, I ask my father how I look. He tells me I might as well get undressed, Vm not going to my uncle&rsquo;s. He and my mother are going without me. He says that&rsquo;s just what my uncle wants, a whining brat hanging around. I get mad and I tell him my uncle does so want to see me, or else why would he give me so much money? My father laughs, saying do I actually think the gift has anything to do with me.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: How do you feel?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ALISON: I feel that same way. Exposed. Like all of a sudden I realize the gift wasn &rsquo;t really for me. I&rsquo;m embarrassed that I got all dressed up, and the gift wasn&rsquo;t really for me. I&rsquo;m standing in the hall, and I feel so exposed. I&rsquo;m trying really hard not to cry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We want you to feel that child who wanted love but instead got disapproval and rejection. Picture yourself as a child wanting those things. And picture the people you love not giving them to you. Allow yourself to relive that original pain.</p>
<p>Bring yourself in as an adult and comfort that child in the images. Comfort, love, praise, and support can heal shame.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ALISON: I bring myself into the image. I take that little girl&rsquo;s hand, and lead her away from her father. We go outside the house and far away. I take her on my lap and rock and kiss her. I tell her that I love her, that it will be okay, that if she wants to cry she can.</p>

<p>Link these early feelings with your Defectiveness lifetrap today. Can you feel the wounded child who wanted approval and validation?</p>
<p><strong>(2) List Signs That You Might Be Coping with Defectiveness Through Escape or Counterattack (i.e., by avoiding or overcompensating).</strong></p>
<p>Are you hypercritical of other people? Are you defensive about criticism? Do you devalue the people you love? Do you overemphasize status or success? Do you try to impress people? Do you ask for reassurance incessantly? These are the ways you Counterattack or overcompensate.</p>
<p>Do you abuse alcohol or drugs? Do you overeat or overwork? Do you avoid getting close to people? Are you very closed about discussing  personal feelings? Are you hypervigilant about rejection? These are the ways you Escape or avoid.</p>
<p>Make explicit the ways you Escape or Counterattack to cope with your feelings of defectiveness. Watch yourself and write them down.</p>
<p><strong>(3) Try to Stop These Behaviors Designed to Escape or Counterattack.</strong></p>
<p>This will allow your feelings of defectiveness to surface more readily. You cannot deal with your lifetrap until you are in touch with it.</p>
<p>For example, you may place too much emphasis on success as a way of compensating for your feelings of worthlessness. You try to disprove your defectiveness by proving you are of value. But the problem is, you overdo it. It becomes your sole focus, and your life starts to revolve around success. Eliot displayed this pattern:</p>
<p>ELIOT: <em>I always maintain that the main reason I don&rsquo;t spend more time with my family is time. I don&rsquo;t have the time. I&rsquo;m at the club from eleven
in the morning till three or four in the morning at least five nights a week.</em></p>
<p>MARIA: <em>And he spends the days he is home recovering. He really doesn&rsquo;t want to do much but lie in bed or watch television.</em></p>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>All you do is work or recover from work.</em></p>
<p>Eliot&rsquo;s life is devoted to gaining success and status. He does it to impress people. When he is with a woman, it is all he talks about. This is his way of proving himself worthy of love. The end result, though, is that he has status and success, but he still does not have love. He is looking for love but settling for admiration. His success never touches his core feeling of defectiveness. It just provides temporary relief.</p>
<p>Success and status often become addictions. You try to get more and more, but you can never get enough to make you feel good. Success is a pale substitute for finding one person who really knows and loves you.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you are always running away from your feelings of defectiveness—if you are always drinking, avoiding close relationships, or hiding your real thoughts and feelings—your lifetrap cannot change. Your feelings of defectiveness remain frozen.</p>
<p>Eliot avoided intimacy with his family in many ways. On days that he was home, he smoked marijuana and drank beer. Most of the time, he stayed isolated in his bedroom watching television. At dinner he spent most of the time bragging about his success or criticizing his children. Some evenings he made excuses to leave so he could meet one of his lovers.</p>
<p>We made an agreement that he would stop trying to escape in these ways for one month. We want you to do the same. We want you to stop engaging in patterns that keep you from facing your feelings of defectiveness. We want you to get in touch with your defectiveness feelings so that we can begin to work on them.</p>
<p><strong>(4) Monitor Your Feelings of Defectiveness and Shame.</strong></p>
<p>Observe situations that trigger your lifetrap. Become aware. List situations in which you feel defective or ashamed. These feelings are cues that your lifetrap has been triggered. Here is Alison&rsquo;s list:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Situations That Trigger My Defectiveness</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Alone on a Saturday night with nothing to do. Matthew is away. I feel that no one wants to be with me.</li>
<li>Out to lunch with my best friend, Sarah. I feel that she is better than I am—smarter, prettier, more interesting. Instead of  talking about myself, I fade.</li>
<li>Talking to my mother on the phone. She gets down on me for not being able to make up my mind about getting married. She sounds desperate, like if I don&rsquo;t say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; now, no one will ever ask me again.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>List all the ways your lifetrap manifests itself: when you feel insecure, inadequate, or worried about rejection; when you compare yourself to
others or feel jealous; when you feel sensitive to slights or defensive about criticism; when you allow yourself to be mistreated because you believe you do not deserve anything better. List all the situations that trigger Defectiveness for you.</p>
<p>We realize that this will be hard. We all devote considerable energy in life trying not to feel painful things. Try to maintain hope throughout
this process by reminding yourself that acknowledging these feelings is the first step toward overcoming a problem that is bringing you great unhappiness.</p>
<p>In addition, write down the complaints various partners have made about you. See if there are patterns. Have you been accused repeatedly of being too jealous, insecure, or oversensitive? Have you been told that you need too much reassurance, or that your feelings are too easily hurt? These
complaints may provide important clues about how you reinforce your lifetrap.</p>
<p><strong>(5) List the Men/ Women Who Have Attracted You Most, and the Ones Who Have Attracted You Least.</strong></p>
<p>We want you to take a look at your choice of partners. List all the lovers you have had. Group them into the ones that excited you most and the ones that excited you least. Compare the two groups. Were you most excited by partners who were more critical of you? More rejecting? More aloof or ambivalent toward you? Are you most attracted to partners before you have won them over? Does your interest drop off afterward? Were you bored by partners who loved you?</p>
<p><strong>(6) List Your Defects and Assets as a Child and Teenager. Then List Your Current Defects and Assets.</strong></p>
<p>We want you to get a more objective view of yourself. The view you have now is not objective. It is biased against you. Your cognitive style is to exaggerate your flaws and discount your positive features. Take a more scientific approach. List your defects and assets, both when you were a child and teenager, and now.</p>
<p>Here is Alison&rsquo;s list:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Assets as a Child or Teenager</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>I was smart.</li>
<li>I was sensitive.</li>
<li>I was pretty good to other people.</li>
<li>I could sing.</li>
<li>I had leadership qualities. (I was head cheerleader and class representative of my junior and senior class.)</li>
<li>I was good to my younger brother and sister.</li>
<li>I was popular with other girls.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Defects as a Child or Teenager</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>It&rsquo;s hard for me to say what my defects were. I just didn&rsquo;t have much to offer anyone. No one really wanted to be with me. I have always felt that there is something about me that people don&rsquo;t like. I can&rsquo;t really say what it is. It is something about me that other people can see. Boys in particular didn&rsquo;t like me. When I was a teenager, boys didn&rsquo;t ask me out.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>It was interesting for Alison to see how much trouble she had writing this list.</p>
<p>ALISON: <em>It&rsquo;s funny, but writing the positive parts made me upset. It was hard for me to just say what was good about me.</em></p>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>It&rsquo;s so alien to you.</em></p>
<p>ALISON: <em>And writing the negative part was hard too. At first it surprised me that I couldn Y think of any defects. But then I realized it wasn Y any one thing about me. It was who I was.</em></p>
<p>Alison had a similar experience writing the list for herself now. Although it was not easy, she was able to generate many positive qualities. But she had difficulty listing any significant defects. Her only evidence was that she felt defective.</p>
<p>These lists represent the evidence that you are defective versus the evidence that you have value. Examine the evidence. Writing the lists helped Alison to see that there were positive things about her that she tended to discount.</p>
<p>You can also turn to family and close friends for help developing your lists. (Of course, do not ask the people in your family who gave you the lifetrap in the first place.) At first Alison could not generate any positive qualities at all. She was just unaccustomed to thinking that way.</p>
<p>ALISON: <em>You know, each positive quality that people told me about, my first reaction was that I knew that, but I just didn&rsquo;t think it was very
important I mean, I know I&rsquo;m a nice person, I know there were good things about me. I just didn &rsquo;t think that it mattered in terms of my total worth.</em></p>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>You automatically devalue everything you do well.</em></p>
<p>When you think of good qualities, do not minimize them and leave them off the list. If people give you positive feedback that you find hard to believe, include it anyway. Include everything, without passing judgment.</p>
<p>Play down qualities that are success-oriented—assets that may be part of your false self. And when you ask people what they value about you, be sure to get specifics. Do not settle for general comments like &ldquo;You&rsquo;re great,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I like you.&rdquo; Unless they specify what they like, you will assume they are describing only your false self and not the real you.</p>
<p>You will be surprised to find that people are happy to give you feedback. We have seen amazing changes in patients' feelings about themselves just by being willing to ask for positive feedback from their friends and loved ones.</p>
<p><strong>(7) Evaluate the Seriousness of Your Current Defects.</strong></p>
<p>When your list is finished, ask yourself how you would feel about someone else who had these assets and liabilities. Keep in mind that everyone has flaws. Everyone has both good and bad qualities.</p>
<p>ALISON: <em>I have to admit I would think this was an okay person. Maybe someone who has problems with men, but an okay person. But I still feel that I&rsquo;m not okay. I mean I know Vm okay, but I still feel like I&rsquo;m not.</em></p>
<p>Like Alison, you may not feel better at this point. But we want you to recognize, intellectually at least, that you are a worthwhile person. And we want you to be able to say why.</p>
<p>Review your assets list daily. Try not to discount them anymore. Chip away at the lifetrap. This will help you make the gradual transition from
intellectual knowledge to emotional acceptance.</p>
<p><strong>(8) Start a Program to Correct the Flaws That Are Changeable.</strong></p>
<p>Which of your limitations could you change? Many people find that their defects are situational or changeable, not inherent or immutable. Start a program to correct the limitations you can change.</p>
<p>We often find that the defects patients list are the result of their lifetrap, not the cause. That is, they are the manifestations of the lifetrap
itself. Both Alison and Eliot found that a lot of their flaws were actually mechanisms they had developed to cope with their feelings of defectiveness.</p>
<p>For example, we tried to piece together Alison&rsquo;s defect, that &ldquo;boys didn&rsquo;t like me&rdquo; (which translated into &ldquo;Men don&rsquo;t find me attractive&rdquo; on her adult list). She asked some of her male friends, and they confirmed she had some attributes that might be unattractive to men. Basically, she came
across as too eager and too insecure. We could confirm this as well, based on her relationship with us. But, all of these behaviors are lifetrap-driven. In fact, Alison could not name a single defect that was independent of her lifetrap. Clearly, her defectiveness reflected how she had been treated as a child, and not anything about who she was.</p>
<p>Once Alison became aware of these lifetrap-driven behaviors, it was fairly easy for her to stop them.</p>
<p>ALISON: <em>When I&rsquo;m with Matthew, and I feel all needy and jealous, I tell myself it won&rsquo;t help at all to start bugging him about it. I tell myself it will just make me feel worse.</em></p>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>How will it make you feel?</em></p>
<p>ALISON: <em>Weak and kind of worthless. Plus it gets him mad at me. It just doesn &rsquo;t help. I do the same thing when I&rsquo;m at work, and I get the urge
to call him to make sure he still cares. I stop myself. I tell myself it won&rsquo;t help at all. I feel much better since I&rsquo;ve stopped making those frantic phone calls.</em></p>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>So, if you don&rsquo;t start acting needy, what do you do instead?</em></p>
<p>ALISON: <em>I talk to myself I tell myself it&rsquo;s okay, he loves me. I tell myself I&rsquo;m worthy of his love.</em></p>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>Good. You comfort yourself.</em></p>
<p>Similarly, Eliot&rsquo;s flaws were mostly forms of counterattack or ways he overcompensated: his criticalness, his need to impress people, his workaholism, his infidelity. As we noted before, Eliot agreed to stop these behaviors for one month.</p>
<p>ELIOT: <em>The odd thing is that I feel more relaxed and more in control Especially at work. Nobody&rsquo;s throwing me off at all.</em></p>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>It&rsquo;s a feeling of being more centered.</em></p>
<p>What was hard for Eliot was spending time with his wife and children being himself. Suddenly he was face-to-face with them, with his mask off.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ELIOT: <em>I feel nervous around them. Like I don&rsquo;t quite know what to talk about. And I feel ashamed of how I treated them. Especially the kids.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>The important thing is that you&rsquo;re treating them well now.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ELIOT: <em>It&rsquo;s true. Maria and the kids seem happier.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>What about you?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ELIOT: <em>Yes. At some level I&rsquo;m happier too. Like the other day, my younger daughter threw her arms around me and gave me a kiss. It startled me. She hadn&rsquo;t done that in a long time.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>(9) Write a Letter to Your Critical Parentis).</strong></p>
<p>We want you to write letters to the people in your family who criticized you when you were a child. You are under no pressure to send these letters. In fact, you probably will not want to send them. The important thing is for you to feel totally free to express your feelings in the letters. We want you to vent the anger and the sadness in response to the people who treated you badly. We want you to talk back.</p>
<p>Tell them what they did to you when you were a child. Tell them how it felt to be criticized and invalidated. Explain why you did not deserve to be treated this way. Stress the good qualities you had that they overlooked or downplayed.</p>
<p>Tell them how you wished it could have been. Tell them about the support and approval you needed—what it would have meant to you and how it would have changed your life. And tell them what you want from them now.</p>
<p>Do not make excuses for these family members, or rationalize their criticisms. You can do that laterf if you choose. The road to healing is long;
at the end, you may forgive them, when you do not feel defective anymore. But first you must stand up for yourself and vent the feelings you have
buried.</p>
<p>We understand that you may have a strong impulse to defend your parents, even if they were the ones who hurt you. You want to see your parents as good people. So you say things like, &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t know any better,&rdquo; or &ldquo;They had problems themselves,&rdquo; or &ldquo;They were doing it for my own good.&rdquo; In this letter, try to stop defending them and just focus on being honest about what happened and how it made you feel.</p>
<p>Here is the letter Eliot wrote to his father:</p>
<p><em>Dear Dad,</em></p>
<p><em>You were cruel to me when I was a child. You acted as though I had nothing worthwhile about me, nothing special or great. I just didn&rsquo;t matter to you. You didn&rsquo;t care that I had feelings, that I could feel pain or get hurt. You couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to give me love.</em></p>
<p><em>What hurt most was how you always compared me to [my brother]Rick. You made me feel like nothing next to him. When you were around Rick, you &rsquo;d act all happy and excited. But when you were around me, you were mean and disgusted. Like I was such a disappointment.</em></p>
<p><em>You criticized everything about me. I had no part of me I felt safe to show you. Anything I loved, I kept hidden from you. When I remember my childhood, the thing that stands out most is feeling ashamed.</em></p>
<p><em>Despite how you treated me, I had some great qualities as a kid. I was smart. I could wheel and deal. By the time I was sixteen, I had a little business going in baseball cards. I had my own interests (not that you cared), different from Rick&rsquo;s. Maybe I wasn&rsquo;t perfect, but it was wrong to treat me the way you did.</em></p>
<p><em>I hate you for what you did to me. My wife is threatening to leave me, my kids are miserable, and I&rsquo;m working myself sick trying to just feel like a worthwhile person. I&rsquo;ve shut out the ones I love, and instead I spend all my time boosting my ego with cocaine or trying to pick up chicks I couldn&rsquo;t care less about. And all these things are happening because I have such low self-esteem, because you and the rest of the family were so crummy to me.</em></p>
<p><em>All of you let me down. Did you ever think what it would have meant for me to have you once seem happy about me, once seem proud or pleased with who I was? It made me shut down. It made it so I didn&rsquo;t want to show anyone who I was.</em></p>
<p><em>I am trying now to grope towards a more meaningful life. Part of this is that it&rsquo;s no longer acceptable for you to insult me in any way. If you want to maintain a relationship, you are going to have to change how you treat me. And if you can&rsquo;t, our  relationship is over.</em></p>
<p><em>Eliot</em></p>
<p>It was not easy by any means for Eliot to get to the point where he could write this letter. It took courage and strength on his part. But one thing was certain. He felt markedly better afterwards.</p>
<p>You will find the same. Writing a letter like this can be a healing process. It is a statement of what happened to you. &ldquo;Your truth shall set you free.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>(10) Write a Flashcard for Yourself.</strong></p>
<p>Make a flashcard that you can take out and read whenever your Defectiveness lifetrap is triggered—whenever, as Alison says, &ldquo;the voice of my father starts yammering in my head.&rdquo; We want you to chip away at the critical parent within you.</p>
<p>ALISON: <em>I want to be better to myself, but getting down on myself is a hard habit to break. I keep deciding not to do it, but then find myself doing it a minute later.</em></p>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>Yes. And, like every habit, the way to stop is to catch yourself, and to stop yourself every time.</em></p>
<p>The flashcard is a weapon against the voice of the lifetrap. It keeps you aware that there are two sides. There is the critical or unloving parent
you have internalized, who is always putting you down, ignoring you, and making you feel defective and ashamed. But there is also the vulnerable child inside, who wants love, acceptance, approval, and validation. The flashcard helps you push the critical parent out, so your healthy side can give the child what he or she wants. Ultimately this healing process is about self-love. The flashcard helps you remember to give yourself love.</p>
<p>The flashcard should have on it all of the qualities in you that are good. It should invalidate your parents' criticisms—why the things they said were either wrong or less important than they made them out to be. Use objective evidence. Tell yourself to use a <em>constructive</em> tone with  yourself, not a <em>punitive</em> tone.</p>
<p>Here is the card Alison wrote:</p>
<p><strong>A Defectiveness Flashcard</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Right now I feel humiliated and inadequate. I feel surrounded by people, especially women, who seem superior to me in every way— looks, brains, personality. I feel their presence diminishes me totally.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>But this is not true. What is really going on is that my lifetrap is being triggered. The truth is that I am worthy too. I am sensitive, intelligent, loving, and good. The truth is that many people have found me to be worthy of love: [lists their names]. Generally I have not given people a chance to get close enough to really know and appreciate me. But believing what I say on this card will help me move in this direction.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Carry the card around. Use it to review your good points. Refute your constant put-downs of yourself. It is another way to fight the feeling of
shame and unlovability.</p>
<p><strong>(11) Try to Be More Genuine in Close Relationships.</strong></p>
<p>Alison and Eliot are at opposite extremes of the lifetrap. Alison is too vulnerable, while Eliot is not vulnerable enough. Alison had to learn to protect herself better, and Eliot had to learn to reveal more of who he was.</p>
<p>If you are more like Eliot, try to be more genuine in close relationships. Stop trying to give the impression that you are perfect. Be vulnerable.
Share some of your secrets. Acknowledge some of your flaws. Let other people inside more. You will find that your secrets are not as humiliating
as they feel to you. Everyone has flaws.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ELIOT: <em>I did something that surprised me. The other night Maria and I went to a party. One of her friends from college, this guy Richard, was there. They were talking and I got jealous. I always get jealous when they&rsquo;re together, because they seem so into talking to each other. They look so happy. Like Maria and I never are. My usual maneuver would have been to start hitting on some chick. But I didn &rsquo;t do that. Instead I told Maria. I told her I felt jealous.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>What happened?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ELIOT: <em>Her reaction was, &ldquo;So you care? I didn&rsquo;t think you cared&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because he was so afraid of looking insecure, Eliot withheld from Maria the signs of his caring. He was afraid to show her he loved her. In this case, showing a normal and appropriate amount of jealousy was actually helpful.</p>
<p>You can pace how much you reveal of yourself. Reveal yourself little by little. Keep a sense of control. In the early stages of a relationship, exposing too much insecurity can, in fact, turn the other partner off. There is an inevitable strategic element during the first few months. However, as you become more intimate and you sense that your partner seems genuinely to care for you, you can disclose more and more. It can be a risk to expose everything all at once.</p>
<p>Sometimes patients say, &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know what a normal rate of showing vulnerability is.&rdquo; If this is the case, one solution is to pace yourself according to your partner. As your partner shows more vulnerability, you show more. Try to keep a balance in the relationship.</p>
<p>If you have secrets—humiliating things that happened to you, for example—gradually tell them to people close to you. There is an  expression, &ldquo;You are only as sick as your worst secret.&rdquo; Many things that we hide from people are not as bad as we think. Once we share them with someone, we see that they are not so shameful. We see that the person still loves us, and we feel better about ourselves.</p>
<p>You may have so much shame that you have always hidden yourself. You need to find out that you can actually be yourself and be loved for that.</p>
<p><strong>(12) Accept Love from the People Close to You.</strong></p>
<p>One of the hardest things for you is to let people love you. You are very uncomfortable being treated well. It is so alien. You are much more comfortable being mistreated or ignored. It is hard for you to tolerate situations where people take care of you, praise you, and support you. You try to push it away or discount it. ALISON: It&rsquo;s funny, but one of the hardest things for me has been to let Matthew give me compliments. To just accept them without denying them. Like the other night, we were going out to dinner, and he told me I looked beautiful. I started to say, &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and then I stopped myself</p>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>What did you say?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ALISON: <em>&ldquo;Thank you.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both Alison and Eliot had to learn to accept love. Surprisingly, the experience brought up a lot of grief for both of them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MARIA: <em>Something strange happened the other night. Eliot came home from the club and he was all upset. He had had a bad night. I lay down in bed with him, held him in my arms, and just comforted him. I was stroking his face. All of a sudden he started to cry. These deep sobs.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>It put him in touch with what he&rsquo;d been missing for so long.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>MARIA: <em>I never felt closer to him or loved him so much.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We want you to accept love as well. Stop pushing away the people who love you.</p>
<p><strong>(13) Stop Allowing People to Treat You Badly.</strong></p>
<p>As we have noted, there is a tendency for you to choose partners, and perhaps close friends, who are critical or rejecting. Examine your close relationships today. Do you allow people to put you down or criticize you unfairly?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ALISON: <em>Well, you know Matthew isn&rsquo;t a problem that way. But there is someone who is a problem. That&rsquo;s my best friend Lynn. She&rsquo;s been my best friend since we were little. She lived next door to me.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>She was always mean to me when we were little. She would say she didn &rsquo;t want to play with me, or she would make fun of me.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To this day she puts me down. Like the other day she said to me, &ldquo;You better let Matthew get you that ring before he changes his mind.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>That was such a bitchy thing to say.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>What did you do when she said it?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ALISON: <em>Nothing. I got upset.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Start standing up for yourself. Assert your rights. Tell the person that you will no longer tolerate abusive criticism. Demand that you be accepted as you are. Remember the principles of assertiveness. Do not talk to the person in an angry and aggressive manner. You will be much more
effective if you remain calm. Stand up straight and look the person in the eye. Be direct. Be specific. And above all, do not get into defending yourself. Just keep restating your point in a calm and controlled manner.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ALISON: <em>I invited Lynn to dinner and she came two hours late. We had finally started eating, so it meant I had to get up and start getting her courses. All the food was either cold or overcooked. I was really annoyed.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>At one point we were alone at the table. I told her that I was angry she had come so late, that it had made it hard for me and ruined my dinner. I told her I had worked hard on the dinner.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>She started saying I had some nerve to get down on her when she was so upset about Lenny. Lenny is her boyfriend. They had had a fight and that was why she was late.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I didn&rsquo;t fall for it. I started to defend myself but I stopped myself. I just told her again that it wasn&rsquo;t right for her to be so late for dinner.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Be careful not to go too far in the other direction. Try to accept occasional criticism that is not demeaning. Recognize the difference between fair criticism and excessive or unreasonable criticism.</p>
<p>If your friend or partner will not change after a while, you must consider ending the relationship. You can try everything; you can give the person every opportunity to change. If it is a romantic partner, you might consider couples therapy. Perhaps through therapy you can solve the problem. But ultimately you must stand up for yourself and either get the person to change or leave the relationship. It is going to be almost  impossible for you to heal the Defectiveness lifetrap without ending unhealthy relationships. It is too difficult to fight this lifetrap when the people closest to you are continually reinforcing it.</p>
<p>We have found that the majority of patients with this lifetrap are in relationships that can be saved. They can stand up to their partners and get their partners to change. The partners are often able to stop being so critical. In fact, some partners welcome the change. They prefer to be with a person who has some backbone.</p>
<p>Occasionally we run up against partners who cannot tolerate being in a relationship on an equal basis. Most often this is because the partner&rsquo;s issue is Defectiveness as well. They put down other people as a form of Counterattack, to ward off their own feelings of worthlessness and shame. Such partners are not healthy enough to work on their own insecurities and change.</p>
<p>Some patients continue as adults to live or work with the critical or unloving parents who were responsible for the lifetrap developing in the first place. We have found this to be extremely destructive to the change process, and strongly advise you not to continue such close contact with a critical parent.</p>
<p><strong>(14) If You Are in a Relationship Where You Are the Critical Partner, Stop Putting Your Partner Down. Do the Same in Other Close Relationships.</strong></p>
<p>Stop criticizing your partner. Your partner does not deserve it. Remember, you cannot feel basically better about yourself by putting others down.
This is equally true with your children. They are innocent and vulnerable, and you are betraying them. Break the chain. Do not pass on your own
Defectiveness lifetrap to them. At some level you feel guilty about what you have done to your spouse or children. Resist getting lost in that guilt. The important thing is to change now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ELIOT: <em>When I let myself think about it, I get very upset about things I&rsquo;ve said to the children. But I know I didn&rsquo;t choose my lifetrap; I know I didn &rsquo;t bring it on myself Now I have to get out of the lifetrap for the sake of my children.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>If you can fight your own feelings of defectiveness, you won&rsquo;t have to keep venting them on your children.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You have to face what you have done, forgive yourself, and change, starting right now.</p>
<p>Try praising the ones you love. You love them for a reason. They have qualities that are valuable and deserve credit. Aim for a relationship of equals—beyond the see-saw of one-up, one-down.</p>
<p><strong>SOME FINAL WORDS</strong></p>
<p>How quickly you can change your Defectiveness lifetrap depends in part on how punitive your parent was. The more punishing and dramatic your parent&rsquo;s rejection was, and the more hatred and violence there was  connected to it, the harder it is to change. You may need help from a therapist. Get help if you need it; there is no shame involved in getting help to treat your problem.</p>
<p>Changing your lifetrap involves gradually improving how you treat yourself, how you treat others, and how you allow others to treat you. With the exception of patients who are in truly abusive relationships, changing does not usually involve sudden, dramatic shifts. Rather it is an  incremental process. Patients gradually feel better about themselves. They become less defensive and more able to take in love. They feel closer to people. They feel more valued and more loved.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this is not a short-term issue. You will be working on it for years to come but there will be progress all along the way. Gradually you will come to accept that your defectiveness was something that was taught to you, and not something inherently true about you. Once
you can open yourself up to the idea that your defectiveness is not a fact, the healing process can begin to work.</p>

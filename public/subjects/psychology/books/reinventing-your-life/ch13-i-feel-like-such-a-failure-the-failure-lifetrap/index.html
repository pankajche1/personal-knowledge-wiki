<p>When Kathleen first walks into our office, she has a tense, crestfallen appearance. She tells us that she has considered coming to therapy for quite some time, but has put it off.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>KATHLEEN: <em>Lately I&rsquo;ve been feeling really depressed.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>How did it start?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>KATHLEEN: <em>Well, I&rsquo;ve really been depressed for a long time. Sometimes I think I&rsquo;ve been depressed my whole life. But something happened a few weeks ago that really upset me. My husband and I were out to dinner and we ran into my friend Ronnie. We went to college together. We got to talking, you know, and I found out that she just had been made a partner in her law firm.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>And that bothered you?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>KATHLEEN: <em>Yeah, it bothered me. I mean, look at me. Thirty-eight years old and all I have to show for it is a job as a production assistant. I mean, I&rsquo;m basically a go-fer, and have been for fifteen years.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kathleen works as a production assistant in television. It is basically an entry-level job, which she has held since she started in the business after graduating from college. She has made almost no progress up the ranks. &ldquo;I feel like such a failure,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> Fifty years old. Feels like a failure even though he is a success.</p>
<p>Brian has the impostor syndrome. People with this problem do not feel that their successes are justified. They believe that they fool people into seeing them as more competent than they really are. Although Brian has a good job as a press secretary for a prominent politician, he still feels like a failure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BRIAN: <em>I&rsquo;m not crazy. I know I have a great job, that people think I&rsquo;m great. People think I&rsquo;m doing well. But still I feel worried constantly. It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m an approval junkie. If my boss tells me I did a great job, I&rsquo;m on cloud nine, but if he makes one tiny correction I start worrying that he doesn&rsquo;t like me anymore, he&rsquo;s gonna fire me.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>Like he&rsquo;s found you out.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>BRIAN: <em>Yeah, like I&rsquo;ve just been faking it all along, and he&rsquo;s finally found me out.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THE FAILURE QUESTIONNAIRE</strong></p>
<p>This questionnaire will measure the strength of your Failure lifetrap. Use the following scale to answer the items. Rate what you feel more than what you think intellectually.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring Key</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Completely untrue of me</li>
<li>Mostly untrue of me</li>
<li>Slightly more true than untrue</li>
<li>Moderately true of me</li>
<li>Mostly true of me</li>
<li>Describes me perfectly</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have any 5&rsquo;s or 6&rsquo;s on this questionnaire, this lifetrap may still apply to you, even if your score is in the low range.</p>

<p><strong>Interpreting Your Failure Score</strong></p>
<p>10-19 Very low. This lifetrap probably does not apply to you. <br>
20-29 Fairly low. This lifetrap may only apply occasionally. <br>
30-39 Moderate. This lifetrap is an issue in your life. <br>
40-49 High. This is definitely an important lifetrap for you. <br>
50-60 Very high. This is definitely one of your core lifetraps.</p>
<p><strong>THE EXPERIENCE OF FAILURE</strong></p>
<p>You feel like a failure relative to other people you consider your peers. Most of the time, you are probably in touch with your lifetrap, and your sense of failure is close to the surface.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>KATHLEEN: <em>I&rsquo;m just a stupid person. I don&rsquo;t have what it takes to get ahead. Over and over, I watch younger people get jobs at my level and then pass by me. <br>
I mean, I&rsquo;m thirty-eight years old and I&rsquo;m competing for promotions with twenty-two and twenty-three-year-olds. It&rsquo;s humiliating. You can&rsquo;t get much worse than that.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As with Kathleen, your feelings of failure are painful.</p>
<p>Most of the people with this lifetrap are more like Kathleen than Brian. That is, their actual level of achievement is lower than their potential. Their outward status generally matches their inner sense of failure. Occasionally, we see people like Brian, who have achieved a great deal but feel fraudulent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BRIAN: <em>I feel really out of place where I work. I feel like everyone around me is top-shelf I don&rsquo;t belong there. Somehow I&rsquo;ve deceived everyone into thinking I&rsquo;m more intelligent and competent than I am. And it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before they all discover the truth.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In any case, no matter what your actual status or degree of accomplishment, the inner world is the same. Whether you appear to be a success or not, most of the time you experience yourself as a failure. Both Kathleen and Brian feel that because of their own shortcomings, they are doomed to fail.</p>
<p>You reinforce the Failure lifetrap primarily through Escape. Your avoidance is what holds you back. You avoid taking the steps necessary to widen your knowledge and advance your career. You let opportunities for success pass you by. You are afraid that if you try you will fail.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>KATHLEEN: <em>A few weeks ago I went and talked to my boss about letting me be in charge of scheduling for this one project. It&rsquo;s really rare for me to make that kind of move, but I just felt like I had to do it. Anyway, my boss told me to write up a proposal. You know, a plan, whatever. Well, three weeks have gone by and I still haven&rsquo;t done it. The project is starting tomorrow and now it&rsquo;s really too late.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the Failure lifetrap, the degree to which you use Escape as a coping style is often massive. People avoid developing skills, tackling new tasks, taking on responsibility—all the challenges that might enable them to succeed. Often the attitude is, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; You feel there is no point in making the effort when you are doomed to fail anyway.</p>
<p>Your avoidance may be subtle. You may appear to tackle your work but still do things to avoid. You procrastinate, you get distracted, you do the work improperly, or you mishandle the tasks you take on. These are all forms of self sabotage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BRIAN: <em>This last project my boss gave me to do, Vve been so anxious about it that I didn &lsquo;tget started until this week. Vm really underpressure now. I can&rsquo;t possibly do the job the way it should be done at this point. The whole thing has got me so frazzled.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your tendency to run away from the possibility of failure undermines your ability to do a good job. You may suffer real penalties, such as getting
demoted or fired.</p>
<p>Another way you surrender to your lifetrap is by constantly twisting events and circumstances to reinforce your view of yourself as a failure.
You exaggerate the negative and minimize the positive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BRIAN: <em>I know I blow things out of proportion. Like yesterday, my boss gave me this really positive feedback about a press release I had written. But he criticized one tiny detail about it. And of course I went home and fretted about that detail all night. You may also have feelings of depression.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>KATHLEEN: <em>I just feel like Tm at a certain point in my life, and I haven&rsquo;t gotten to where I want to be. And I feel like Tm never gonna get there. You feel depressed about your failures, and see little hope for change. The Failure lifetrap is usually an easy lifetrap to assess. You are
probably well aware of your painful feelings of failure. The origin of this lifetrap lies in feelings of failure in childhood. This can happen a number of different ways:</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Origins of the Failure Lifetrap</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>You had a parent (often your father) who was very critical of your performance in school, sports, etc. He/She often called you stupid, dumb, inept, a failure, etc. He/She may have been abusive. (Your lifetrap may be linked to Defectiveness or Abuse.)</li>
<li>One or both parents were very successful, and you came to believe you could never live up to their high standards. So you stopped trying. (Your lifetrap may be linked to Unrelenting Standards.)</li>
<li>You sensed that one or both of your parents either did not care about whether you were successful, or, worse, felt threatened when you did well. Your parent may have been competitive with you—or afraid of losing your companionship if you were too successful in the world. (Your lifetrap may be linked to Emotional Deprivation or Dependence.)</li>
<li>You were not as good as other children either in school or at sports, and felt inferior. You may have had a learning disability, poor attention span, or been very uncoordinated. After that, you stopped trying in order to avoid humiliation by them. (This may be linked to Social Exclusion.)</li>
<li>You had brothers or sisters to whom you were often compared unfavorably. You came to believe you could never measure up, so you stopped trying.</li>
<li>You came from a foreign country, your parents were immigrants, or your family was poorer or less educated than your schoolmates. You felt inferior to your peers and never felt you could measure up.</li>
<li>Your parents did not set enough limits for you. You did not learn self-discipline or responsibility. Therefore you failed to do homework regularly or learn study skills. This led to failure eventually. (Your lifetrap may be linked to Entitlement.)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong></p>
<p>As you can see, the Failure lifetrap may be associated with other lifetraps—Defectiveness, Abuse, Unrelenting Standards, Emotional Deprivation, Dependence, Social Exclusion, or Entitlement.</p>
<p>Kathleen had a number of forces propelling her toward failure as a child.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>KATHLEEN: <em>One thing that hurt me was that my parents didn Y really care about school. It was part of their general not caring about me really. I mean, other kids would be scared to death to bring their report cards home. I never worried about it because they just didn Y care. My problem
was getting them to look at it long enough to sign it. <br>
It&rsquo;s weird, but I used to be jealous of kids who were scared to bring their report cards home. I remember once being in the girls</em> room at school with my friend Meg. She was in the stall, crying and carrying on, &ldquo;I can &lsquo;tgo home, my father&rsquo;s gonna kill me,&rdquo; on and on. And as upset as she was, I felt jealous of her. Isn&rsquo;t that weird?*</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>She had someone who cared.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>KATHLEEN: *Yeah. But the other thing that happened was that I was sick a lot. I had asthma. I missed a lot of school in those early years. I fell behind and just never caught up. It&rsquo;s a miracle, really, that I ever made it through college.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was no one to help Kathleen when she fell behind. Nobody pushed her to catch up. Instead she began her lifelong pattern of escape.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>KATHLEEN: <em>I would try to get out of going to school by playing sick. If there was a test or a paper due, I would get sick that day. I just couldn&rsquo;t face the humiliation of failing again.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>Would you try to learn the stuff?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>KATHLEEN: <em>Nah. I would just watch television. I spent my childhood watching television.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kathleen failed to develop the skills and discipline necessary to get ahead. Her approach was to try to do as little as possible and hide it as best as she could.</p>
<p>Kathleen&rsquo;s lifetrap was an outgrowth of Emotional Deprivation. For Brian the issue was more one of Defectiveness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BRIAN: <em>My father was always criticizing me about everything, not just about school. Actually achievement was the one area where I could sort of do okay. But I never trusted it, I never trusted that I really knew what I was doing.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brian had been feeling fraudulent about success for a long time. As a child, he did well in school, but he felt so defective generally that he could not believe in himself.</p>
<p>Upon reflection it seemed that his father felt competitive with him. He put Brian down as a way of feeling better about himself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BRIAN: *Particularly after he lost his job and we had to move to a smaller house, when I was eight, he would really light into me. He would boost himself up by humiliating me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His father was threatened by Brian&rsquo;s success at school. He was afraid that Brian would surpass him, so he punished Brian for succeeding. His father undermined his self-confidence and damaged Brian&rsquo;s ability to believe in himself.</p>
<p>The Failure lifetrap feeds on itself in such a way that the entire arena of work becomes a disaster for you. Your expectation of failure becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy. Here are many of the ways you sabotage yourself and make sure that you remain a failure.</p>
<p><strong>Failure Lifetraps</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>You do not take the steps necessary to develop solid skills in your career (e.g., finish schooling, read latest developments, apprentice to an expert). You coast or try to fool people.</li>
<li>You choose a career below your potential (e.g., you finished college and have excellent mathematical ability, but are currently driving a taxicab).</li>
<li>You avoid taking the steps necessary to get promotions in your chosen career; your advancement has been unnecessarily halted (e.g., you fail to accept promotions or to ask for them; you do not promote yourself or make your abilities widely known to the people who count; you stay in a safe, dead-end job).</li>
<li>You do not want to tolerate working for other people, or working at entry-level jobs, so you end up on the periphery of your field, failing to work your way up the ladder. (Note the overlap with Entitlement and Subjugation.)</li>
<li>You take jobs but repeatedly get fired because of lateness, procrastination, poor job performance, bad attitude, etc.</li>
<li>You cannot commit to one career, so you float from job to job, never developing expertise in one area. You are a generalist in a job world that rewards specialists. You therefore never progress very far in any one career.</li>
<li>You selected a career in which it is extraordinarily hard to succeed, and you do not know when to give up (e.g., acting, professional sports, music).</li>
<li>You have been afraid to take initiative or make decisions independently at work, so you were never promoted to more responsible positions.</li>
<li>You feel that you are basically stupid or untalented, and therefore feel fraudulent, even though objectively you have been quite successful.</li>
<li>You minimize your abilities and accomplishments, and exaggerate your weaknesses and mistakes. You end wp feeling like a failure, even though you have been as successful as your peers.</li>
<li>You have chosen successful men/women as partners in relationships. You live vicariously through their success while not accomplishing much yourself.</li>
<li>You try to compensate for your lack of achievement or work skills by focusing on other assets (e.g., your looks, charm, youthfulness, sacrificing for others). But underneath you still feel like a failure.</li>
</ol>
<p>Many of these patterns boil down to the issue of Escape: you avoid taking the steps necessary to advance yourself. Through your avoidance, you constantly twist events to reinforce your view of yourself as stupid, untalented, and incompetent.</p>
<p>Excelling in other roles is a way of compensating for the lifetrap. Men might excel in sports or seducing women; women might excel in their looks or ability to give to others. But, particularly for men, it is hard to develop an effective compensation. What does society value more in a man  than achievement? A man who feels like a failure in his career is likely to feel like a failure as a person. Of course, this difference between men and women is changing as careers become more central to women&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>As a teenager Brian compensated for his lifetrap by adopting the image of a rebel. He dressed outlandishly and rode motorcycles. He became skilled at chasing women. He found a way to feel good about himself without tackling the prime issue. He compensated for his feelings of failure by carving out an area of success.</p>
<p>One way Kathleen compensates is by choosing a partner who is successful. Wayne, her husband, is the head writer on a top-rated television show. When she goes to job functions, such as cocktail parties and conventions, she moves in the highest circles.</p>
<p>You may be drawn to other roles or to partners who are successful to compensate for your feelings of failure. This is really another avoidance strategy on your part. It is another way for you to escape facing the challenges of achievement.</p>
<p>These compensations are fragile. They easily collapse, and yield to the feeling of failure. You need to deal with the issue of achievement more
directly.</p>
<p>These are the steps to changing your lifetrap:</p>
<p><em>Changing Your Failure Lifetrap</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Assess whether your feeling of failure is accurate or distorted.</li>
<li>Get in touch with the child inside of you who felt, and still feels, like a failure.</li>
<li>Help your inner child see that you were treated unfairly.</li>
<li>Become aware of your talents, skills, abilities, and accomplishments in the area of achievement. If you have, in fact, failed relative to your peers:</li>
</ol>
<p><em>If you have, in fact, failed relative to your peers:</em></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Try to see the pattern in your failures.</li>
<li>Once you see your pattern, make a plan to change it.</li>
<li>Make a flashcard to overcome your blueprint for failure. Follow your plan, step-by-step.</li>
<li>Involve your loved ones in the process.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s discuss the above points one by one in details:</p>
<p><strong>(1) Assess Whether Your Feeling of Failure Is Accurate or Distorted.</strong></p>
<p>The first thing to do is assess the accuracy of your feeling of failure. As we have noted, most of the time, like Kathleen, you will have a lot of realistic evidence. You have in fact failed relative to your peers. But sometimes, like Brian, your perception of failure is inaccurate, and you will find little evidence to support your view.</p>
<p>List a range of people with whom you went to high school, college, or graduate school. Be sure to choose people from the bottom, middle, and top of your class. Write down what each person has accomplished within their chosen fields. How far have they progressed? How much are they paid? How much responsibility do they have at work? Where do you stand in comparison?</p>
<p><strong>(2) Get in Touch with the Child Inside of You Who Felt, and Still Feels, Like a Failure.</strong></p>
<p>Try to recall memories of being criticized, humiliated, compared, or discouraged by your family or peers. Understand the origins of your lifetrap.</p>
<p>When something happens in your current life to trigger your Failure lifetrap, take some time to explore the event through imagery. Sit in a dark,
quiet room and close your eyes. Get an image of the current event. Make the image as vivid and emotional as possible. Then let an image come of
when you felt the same way as a child. Do not force the image. Just let it float to the top of your mind. Here is an example from a session with Kathleen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>KATHLEEN: <em>Oh, I really messed up. I feel so bad. I can&rsquo;t believe it. I told my boss the wrong time the moving men were coming with the set pieces. He hired all these guys to come in and work overtime to help move the stuff, and they all came at the wrong time. My boss had to pay them anyway. He was really mad at me. Oh my God, I feel so bad about it. I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about it. (Starts to cry.)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>Do you want to do imagery about this?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>KATHLEEN: <em>Okay. (Cries.)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>Then close your eyes and get an image of this situation that just happened with your boss.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>KATHLEEN: <em>All right. I see myself in my boss&rsquo;s office. He&rsquo;s about to come in to talk to me about what happened.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>How do you feel?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>KATHLEEN: <em>Oh, I feel frantic, really panic-stricken. I&rsquo;m pacing around, I don&rsquo;t know what to do with myself My heart is pounding. Oh, man. Vm
so scared.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>Okay. Now give me another image of when you felt that way before, as a child.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>KATHLEEN: <em>All right. I&rsquo;m in my sixth-grade classroom. My teacher&rsquo;s there, and she&rsquo;s going around the room, and each person&rsquo;s presenting this
book report. We had all had to read part of this book on Africa the night before and make up a little presentation. Only of course I didn &rsquo;t do it. I didn&rsquo;t do it, and now she&rsquo;s going around the room and she&rsquo;s gonna come to me, and I&rsquo;m gonna have nothing to say.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your images can help you understand the origins of your lifetrap. That child who felt like a failure is still very much alive in you.</p>
<p><strong>(3) Help Your Inner Child See That You Were Treated Unfairly.</strong></p>
<p>Many times when we fail as a child, it is because we are being pushed in a direction that is not naturally ours. Some parents have their own agendas, and want a child to excel in certain areas regardless of what the child&rsquo;s particular talents and inclinations might be. Brian&rsquo;s father was a first-generation immigrant who worked hard to give his children a good education. He wanted Brian to be a doctor. Even when Brian was quite small, his father would tell people that he was going to be a doctor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BRIAN: <em>The trouble was that science and math were not my thing. I was into more creative things—art and writing. My father always looked down on my interest in art. &ldquo;That and fifty cents will get you a ride on the subway,&rdquo; he used to say. <br>
I mean, I did try going pre-med at college. But I just couldn &rsquo;t cut it. That was a really bad time for me. No matter how I tried, I couldn&rsquo;t get more than a &ldquo;C&rdquo; in any of my courses. I almost had a nervous breakdown. <br>
When I switched to creative writing, my father was furious at me. He stopped paying for my education. I had to take out loans. He was really mad. (Imitates his father&rsquo;s voice:) &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so impractical, you&rsquo;ll never make a living.&rdquo; <br>
To this day my father criticizes my job. Even though I have a good job, I&rsquo;m respected, I&rsquo;m mentioned in the newspapers, I make a lot of money, he still gets down on what I do. He&rsquo;ll talk about our neighbor&rsquo;s son, who became a surgeon, and makes some real money.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What were some of your strengths and talents as a child? Were people&rsquo;s expectations of you realistic? How well could you have done if you had been praised, supported, and guided in areas of achievement where you had potential?</p>
<p>Get angry at the people who made you feel like a failure. Talk back to your lifetrap. Stand up for yourself. You can do this by writing letters, talking to people directly, or through imagery.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>Tell your father how you feel in the image. Tell him how his attitude affects you.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>BRIAN: <em>Okay. Dad, when you put me down for my career and talk about how successful doctors are all the time, it really bothers me. First, it&rsquo;s
really frustrating for me to be a success in everyone else&rsquo;s eyes but yours. Every time I see you, I end up feeling like a failure. And this is crazy! I&rsquo;m doing well! Can&rsquo;t you understand that?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Get an image of a parent or a peer, and tell the person how you feel.</p>
<p>It is up to you whether you confront the person directly, in real life. But if you decide to confront someone, make sure you are emotionally prepared for the person to respond by denying your accusations. Do not have false hope that the person is suddenly going to change because of what you say. If this is what happens, great—but do not count on it.</p>
<p>The important thing is for you to confront the person in a way that makes you proud of yourself. Behave well. Stay calm and composed. State your points simply and briefly. If the person argues, just keep restating your position until you have had your say. Tell the person how they make you feel, and how you wish they could be instead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>What did you say to your father?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>BRIAN: <em>I told him that his criticism of me was unfair, that I was really far more talented and competent than I was given credit for as a child. I told him that he did a lot of damage to me by making me feel incompetent. He kept trying to interrupt me, but I just kept asking him politely to let me finish. I told him I wanted him to be more supportive in terms of my work from now on. I wanted him to give me some credit for what I&rsquo;ve accomplished.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>How did it feel?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>BRIAN: <em>Well, it was hard to do, but it felt good afterwards. I still feel good when I think about it.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You will find that it feels good to confront people if you can do it in this controlled, assertive way.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you confront people directly, it is vital for you to confront them in your own heart. Write letters that you do not plan to send, or do imagery exercises. Give a voice to the strong part of you that can reject the label of failure.</p>
<p><strong>(4) Become Aware of Your Talents, Skills, Abilities, and Accomplishments in the Area of Achievement.</strong></p>
<p>Remember an important principle: there are many kinds of intelligence. The intelligence you need to do well in school is not the only kind. There is verbal intelligence, mathematical intelligence, visual-spatial intelligence, musical intelligence, physical intelligence, mechanical intelligence, interpersonal intelligence, etc. All kinds are valid.</p>
<p>What are your special abilities? Do you have a flair for drawing? Are you mechanical or logical? Do you have a gift for sports or dance? Are you creative in some way? Do you get along well with people? It is the rare person who truly has no talents.</p>
<p>Review what you have achieved in each of your talented areas. Try as much as possible to view yourself objectively. We know this will be hard for you—you have a strong tendency to minimize your achievements and maximize your failures. Resist doing this. Stop accentuating the negative. Recognize your own value as accurately as possible.</p>
<p>We need an accurate picture to see whether you have been capitalizing on your own talents. We believe that the people who are most successful are those who can find their natural talents and capitalize on them.</p>
<p>Make a list of your talents, skills, abilities, and accomplishments in the area of achievement, especially your natural talents. Review this list each day to remind yourself of your potential. Get help from friends or significant others in making this list.</p>
<p>Here is the list Brian made:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My Talents and Accomplishments</p>
<ol>
<li>I am a good writer.</li>
<li>I have good ideas. I am creative.</li>
<li>I can argue persuasively.</li>
<li>I am highly self-educated about politics.</li>
<li>I have a good sense of humor, especially about politics.</li>
<li>When my anxiety isn&rsquo;t too high, I accomplish a lot at work.</li>
<li>I am a prominent figure in the New York political scene.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>For those of you like Brian who have an inaccurate sense of failure, steps one to four should be sufficient. These steps should bring about a change in the way you think and feel about yourself.</p>
<p>But this will not be true of most of you. Most of you have a more accurate sense of failure. You will go through steps one through four, and your cumulative conclusion after everything will still be that you are a failure. You can recognize your talents and abilities, you can confront the people who hurt you, you can learn compassion for your inner child, and you can accurately assess what you have achieved thus far. But the conclusion from it all may still be that you feel overwhelmingly like a failure.</p>
<p>Most of you need more. You need <em>behavior change</em>. You have to change your fundamental stance of escape and avoidance into one of confrontation and mastery. Even Brian had areas that he had not developed—he liked to write fiction and never pursued it because of his fathers attitude. And even Brian procrastinated and delayed when faced with anxiety-provoking tasks.</p>
<p>If you <em>have</em>, in fact, failed relative to your peers, continue with the following steps.</p>
<p><strong>(5) Try to See the Pattern in Your Failures.</strong></p>
<p>Take a focused life history. Start from the very beginning. Go through your school and career life. Were you a failure from the start? Or were there indications of potential at the beginning that faded from lack of support?</p>
<p>How did your parents deal with your success and failure? Were they critical, supportive, reinforcing? As a child, did you avoid tasks or did you follow through on them? Did you avoid taking on challenges?</p>
<p>Try to see what your pattern has been in your career. Have you chosen an impossible career? Have you failed to commit to one career? Are you in
a career that vastly underutilizes your potential? Have you been afraid to take responsibility, show initiative, or ask for a promotion? Have you procrastinated, shown a poor attitude, performed poorly at jobs? Have you avoided the discipline necessary to develop skills, get credentials, or receive adequate training?</p>
<p>Most likely, your pattern will boil down to the issue of Escape. You will find that your failure is the direct consequence of your tendency to avoid—rather than the result of some innate deficiency, lack of talent, or ineptness.</p>
<p>Kathleen found a lot of evidence of Escape in her history. Because she was sick a lot, she fell behind at school and never caught up. School became a humiliating experience for her.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>KATHLEEN: <em>I remember so many times being called on by the teacher and not knowing the answer. I would get so embarrassed. Kids made fun of me. They used to call me &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; in the playground.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The more aversive school became, the more Kathleen avoided it. Her frequent sicknesses and her failure at school were like the chicken and the eggs. Each one caused the other in a spiraling vicious cycle.</p>
<p>Kathleen&rsquo;s natural talent was for art. She had a good visual sense and a good sense of design. As a child, for example, she used to redecorate her
room, and draw and paint. But she was unable to capitalize on this ability at school. School was too fraught with anxiety.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>KATHLEEN: <em>I remember once, in high school, this teacher asked me to design the sets for this school play they were doing. We had had a homework assignment to design something, and he liked the job I did. <br>
But I told him, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; I wanted to, but I was really just too scared to do it.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is true that there were subjects at school for which Kathleen had little aptitude. But she could have worked around her weaknesses and played on her strengths, and she did not. The trauma of failure at school led her to avoid everything.</p>
<p><strong>(6) Once You See Your Pattern, Make a Plan to Change It.</strong></p>
<p>At its most basic level, this will involve taking steps to overcome your avoidance. You must start to face challenges instead of running away. Acknowledge your real talents, accept your limitations, and pursue areas that play on your strengths.</p>
<p>Think through how you can begin to pursue the areas where you are most competent. You may have to start a new career to do this. Or you may merely have to change direction slightly in your current career.</p>
<p>What do you have to do to meet your goal? List the behaviors to change in the future. Develop a timeline for change. What is the first step? Stop making excuses and commit yourself to stop Escaping. Risk failure. It is the only way to succeed.</p>
<p>Set up small tasks for yourself. We believe the old cliche, &ldquo;A journey of ten thousand miles begins with a single step.&rdquo; Develop a manageable hierarchy. Make each step reasonable and achievable one after the other. Start with a task you can do; if you start with a task that is too  overwhelming, you are unlikely to succeed.</p>
<p>You have potential, but you have not actually developed it. Because you have avoided so much, you may have some real gaps in your learning. You may have to start at the beginning of your field and develop basic skills. You may even have to go back to school.</p>
<p>Take credit for the progress you make. Reward yourself. Reinforce yourself. Acknowledge the progress you make.</p>
<p>Since Kathleen&rsquo;s strengths are her visual and design abilities, she set a goal to become a television set designer. Oddly enough, she had never pursued this field, even though that was where her interests most lay. Instead she pursued administrative roles, such as scheduling and personnel management. These areas drew upon her weak organizational and administrative skills. She would mishandle her administrative tasks as she jealously watched the set designers proceed with their work.</p>
<p>Kathleen began by observing set designers. She stayed extra hours in order to do this. She slowly developed relationships with the design staff and became a volunteer. She supplemented this by taking some design courses to build basic skills. Eventually she was hired as an apprentice to a designer. This process involved a loss of pay in the short-term, but Kathleen knew she was working her way up.</p>
<p>She made a concerted effort to focus on tasks that used her visual aptitude. She allowed others to perform administrative functions. She stopped setting herself up to fail.</p>
<p>We know this is a hard part of the change process. You will have to push yourself. As your career starts to improve, the positive effects will sustain you. The process will become self-perpetuating. Confronting avoidance almost always has a marked beneficial effect on a person&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Starting is the hardest part. After that it will become easier.</p>
<p><strong>(7) Make a Flashcard to Overcome Your Blueprint for Failure.</strong></p>
<p>Acknowledge your Failure lifetrap and your history of escape. But list the evidence that you have the potential to succeed. Instruct yourself to take the next small step toward success. Remind yourself of the consequences of continuing to avoid.</p>
<p>On the following page is a flashcard we wrote with Kathleen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Failure Flashcard</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Right now I am filled with feelings of failure. This is a familiar feeling. I have felt it all my life. All my life I have avoided taking chances to become a success. All my life I have ignored my design potential, even though teachers pointed it out and I did well in these kinds of classes and enjoyed them. Instead I kept setting myself up to fail by going after things I wasn&rsquo;t good at.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My avoidance developed when I was sick and lonely as a child. When I fell behind, no one helped me to catch up. No one noticed. Running away helped me cope as a child, but it isn&rsquo;t helping me now.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But now I&rsquo;m on track. I&rsquo;m trying to become a set designer. I have a good chance to succeed. I just have to keep myself focused on my path and on the fact that I&rsquo;m making progress.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t start avoiding again. That leads only back to failure. What is my next step? This is what I should be doing. Working on taking my next step.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you begin to make changes, take credit for each small success. Add it to your flashcard.</p>
<p><strong>(8) Involve Your Loved Ones in the Process.</strong></p>
<p>Try to create an interpersonal environment that counters, rather than supports, your Failure lifetrap. If your parent or partner discourages and criticizes you, fight back. Ask for support and encouragement as you take steps to change. If your partner is highly successful, emphasize the importance of succeeding for yourself— even if you do not need a career for financial reasons.</p>
<p><strong>SOME FINAL WORDS</strong></p>
<p>As we have noted, the Failure lifetrap is often connected to other lifetraps. To truly fight the Failure lifetrap, you will probably have to deal with these other issues as well. Brian had to work on his Defectiveness lifetrap, and Pamela had to work on her Emotional Deprivation. Read the chapters on any linked lifetraps. Work to overcome them as well.</p>
<p>The Failure lifetrap is one of the most rewarding to overcome. A whole area of life that is now fraught with shame and tension can become a source of self-esteem. But you have to be willing to fight. You have to be willing to close off your escapes and capitalize on your strengths.</p>
<p><strong>My Notes:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The failure lifetrap is often connected to other lifetraps.</li>
<li>To truly fight this lifetrap, you have to remove those other lifetraps also.</li>
<li>It is one of the most rewarding lifetrap to overcome.</li>

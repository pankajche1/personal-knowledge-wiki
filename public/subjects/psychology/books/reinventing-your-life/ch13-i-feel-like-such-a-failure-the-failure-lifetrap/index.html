<p>When Kathleen first walks into our office, she has a tense, crestfallen appearance. She tells us that she has considered coming to therapy for quite some time, but has put it off.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>KATHLEEN: <em>Lately I&rsquo;ve been feeling really depressed.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>How did it start?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>KATHLEEN: <em>Well, I&rsquo;ve really been depressed for a long time. Sometimes I think I&rsquo;ve been depressed my whole life. But something happened a few weeks ago that really upset me. My husband and I were out to dinner and we ran into my friend Ronnie. We went to college together. We got to talking, you know, and I found out that she just had been made a partner in her law firm.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>And that bothered you?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>KATHLEEN: <em>Yeah, it bothered me. I mean, look at me. Thirty-eight years old and all I have to show for it is a job as a production assistant. I mean, I&rsquo;m basically a go-fer, and have been for fifteen years.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kathleen works as a production assistant in television. It is basically an entry-level job, which she has held since she started in the business after graduating from college. She has made almost no progress up the ranks. &ldquo;I feel like such a failure,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> Fifty years old. Feels like a failure even though he is a success.</p>
<p>Brian has the impostor syndrome. People with this problem do not feel that their successes are justified. They believe that they fool people into seeing them as more competent than they really are. Although Brian has a good job as a press secretary for a prominent politician, he still feels like a failure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BRIAN: <em>I&rsquo;m not crazy. I know I have a great job, that people think I&rsquo;m great. People think I&rsquo;m doing well. But still I feel worried constantly. It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m an approval junkie. If my boss tells me I did a great job, I&rsquo;m on cloud nine, but if he makes one tiny correction I start worrying that he doesn&rsquo;t like me anymore, he&rsquo;s gonna fire me.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>Like he&rsquo;s found you out.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>BRIAN: <em>Yeah, like I&rsquo;ve just been faking it all along, and he&rsquo;s finally found me out.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THE FAILURE QUESTIONNAIRE</strong></p>
<p>This questionnaire will measure the strength of your Failure lifetrap. Use the following scale to answer the items. Rate what you feel more than what you think intellectually.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring Key</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Completely untrue of me</li>
<li>Mostly untrue of me</li>
<li>Slightly more true than untrue</li>
<li>Moderately true of me</li>
<li>Mostly true of me</li>
<li>Describes me perfectly</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have any 5&rsquo;s or 6&rsquo;s on this questionnaire, this lifetrap may still apply to you, even if your score is in the low range.</p>

<p><strong>Interpreting Your Failure Score</strong></p>
<p>10-19 Very low. This lifetrap probably does not apply to you. <br>
20-29 Fairly low. This lifetrap may only apply occasionally. <br>
30-39 Moderate. This lifetrap is an issue in your life. <br>
40-49 High. This is definitely an important lifetrap for you. <br>
50-60 Very high. This is definitely one of your core lifetraps.</p>
<p><strong>THE EXPERIENCE OF FAILURE</strong></p>
<p>You feel like a failure relative to other people you consider your peers. Most of the time, you are probably in touch with your lifetrap, and your sense of failure is close to the surface.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>KATHLEEN: <em>I&rsquo;m just a stupid person. I don&rsquo;t have what it takes to get ahead. Over and over, I watch younger people get jobs at my level and then pass by me. <br>
I mean, I&rsquo;m thirty-eight years old and I&rsquo;m competing for promotions with twenty-two and twenty-three-year-olds. It&rsquo;s humiliating. You can&rsquo;t get much worse than that.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As with Kathleen, your feelings of failure are painful.</p>
<p>Most of the people with this lifetrap are more like Kathleen than Brian. That is, their actual level of achievement is lower than their potential. Their outward status generally matches their inner sense of failure. Occasionally, we see people like Brian, who have achieved a great deal but feel fraudulent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BRIAN: <em>I feel really out of place where I work. I feel like everyone around me is top-shelf I don&rsquo;t belong there. Somehow I&rsquo;ve deceived everyone into thinking I&rsquo;m more intelligent and competent than I am. And it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before they all discover the truth.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In any case, no matter what your actual status or degree of accomplishment, the inner world is the same. Whether you appear to be a success or not, most of the time you experience yourself as a failure. Both Kathleen and Brian feel that because of their own shortcomings, they are doomed to fail.</p>
<p>You reinforce the Failure lifetrap primarily through Escape. Your avoidance is what holds you back. You avoid taking the steps necessary to widen your knowledge and advance your career. You let opportunities for success pass you by. You are afraid that if you try you will fail.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>KATHLEEN: <em>A few weeks ago I went and talked to my boss about letting me be in charge of scheduling for this one project. It&rsquo;s really rare for me to make that kind of move, but I just felt like I had to do it. Anyway, my boss told me to write up a proposal. You know, a plan, whatever. Well, three weeks have gone by and I still haven&rsquo;t done it. The project is starting tomorrow and now it&rsquo;s really too late.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the Failure lifetrap, the degree to which you use Escape as a coping style is often massive. People avoid developing skills, tackling new tasks, taking on responsibility—all the challenges that might enable them to succeed. Often the attitude is, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; You feel there is no point in making the effort when you are doomed to fail anyway.</p>
<p>Your avoidance may be subtle. You may appear to tackle your work but still do things to avoid. You procrastinate, you get distracted, you do the work improperly, or you mishandle the tasks you take on. These are all forms of self sabotage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BRIAN: <em>This last project my boss gave me to do, Vve been so anxious about it that I didn &lsquo;tget started until this week. Vm really underpressure now. I can&rsquo;t possibly do the job the way it should be done at this point. The whole thing has got me so frazzled.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your tendency to run away from the possibility of failure undermines your ability to do a good job. You may suffer real penalties, such as getting
demoted or fired.</p>
<p>Another way you surrender to your lifetrap is by constantly twisting events and circumstances to reinforce your view of yourself as a failure.
You exaggerate the negative and minimize the positive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BRIAN: <em>I know I blow things out of proportion. Like yesterday, my boss gave me this really positive feedback about a press release I had written. But he criticized one tiny detail about it. And of course I went home and fretted about that detail all night. You may also have feelings of depression.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>KATHLEEN: <em>I just feel like Tm at a certain point in my life, and I haven&rsquo;t gotten to where I want to be. And I feel like Tm never gonna get there. You feel depressed about your failures, and see little hope for change. The Failure lifetrap is usually an easy lifetrap to assess. You are
probably well aware of your painful feelings of failure. The origin of this lifetrap lies in feelings of failure in childhood. This can happen a number of different ways:</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Origins of the Failure Lifetrap</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>You had a parent (often your father) who was very critical of your performance in school, sports, etc. He/She often called you stupid, dumb, inept, a failure, etc. He/She may have been abusive. (Your lifetrap may be linked to Defectiveness or Abuse.)</li>
<li>One or both parents were very successful, and you came to believe you could never live up to their high standards. So you stopped trying. (Your lifetrap may be linked to Unrelenting Standards.)</li>
<li>You sensed that one or both of your parents either did not care about whether you were successful, or, worse, felt threatened when you did well. Your parent may have been competitive with you—or afraid of losing your companionship if you were too successful in the world. (Your lifetrap may be linked to Emotional Deprivation or Dependence.)</li>
<li>You were not as good as other children either in school or at sports, and felt inferior. You may have had a learning disability, poor attention span, or been very uncoordinated. After that, you stopped trying in order to avoid humiliation by them. (This may be linked to Social Exclusion.)</li>
<li>You had brothers or sisters to whom you were often compared unfavorably. You came to believe you could never measure up, so you stopped trying.</li>
<li>You came from a foreign country, your parents were immigrants, or your family was poorer or less educated than your schoolmates. You felt inferior to your peers and never felt you could measure up.</li>
<li>Your parents did not set enough limits for you. You did not learn self-discipline or responsibility. Therefore you failed to do homework regularly or learn study skills. This led to failure eventually. (Your lifetrap may be linked to Entitlement.)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong></p>
<p>As you can see, the Failure lifetrap may be associated with other lifetraps—Defectiveness, Abuse, Unrelenting Standards, Emotional Deprivation, Dependence, Social Exclusion, or Entitlement.</p>
<p>Kathleen had a number of forces propelling her toward failure as a child.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>KATHLEEN: <em>One thing that hurt me was that my parents didn Y really care about school. It was part of their general not caring about me really. I mean, other kids would be scared to death to bring their report cards home. I never worried about it because they just didn Y care. My problem
was getting them to look at it long enough to sign it. <br>
It&rsquo;s weird, but I used to be jealous of kids who were scared to bring their report cards home. I remember once being in the girls</em> room at school with my friend Meg. She was in the stall, crying and carrying on, &ldquo;I can &lsquo;tgo home, my father&rsquo;s gonna kill me,&rdquo; on and on. And as upset as she was, I felt jealous of her. Isn&rsquo;t that weird?*</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>She had someone who cared.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>KATHLEEN: *Yeah. But the other thing that happened was that I was sick a lot. I had asthma. I missed a lot of school in those early years. I fell behind and just never caught up. It&rsquo;s a miracle, really, that I ever made it through college.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was no one to help Kathleen when she fell behind. Nobody pushed her to catch up. Instead she began her lifelong pattern of escape.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>KATHLEEN: <em>I would try to get out of going to school by playing sick. If there was a test or a paper due, I would get sick that day. I just couldn&rsquo;t face the humiliation of failing again.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>Would you try to learn the stuff?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>KATHLEEN: <em>Nah. I would just watch television. I spent my childhood watching television.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kathleen failed to develop the skills and discipline necessary to get ahead. Her approach was to try to do as little as possible and hide it as best as she could.</p>
<p>Kathleen&rsquo;s lifetrap was an outgrowth of Emotional Deprivation. For Brian the issue was more one of Defectiveness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BRIAN: <em>My father was always criticizing me about everything, not just about school. Actually achievement was the one area where I could sort of do okay. But I never trusted it, I never trusted that I really knew what I was doing.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brian had been feeling fraudulent about success for a long time. As a child, he did well in school, but he felt so defective generally that he could not believe in himself.</p>
<p>Upon reflection it seemed that his father felt competitive with him. He put Brian down as a way of feeling better about himself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BRIAN: *Particularly after he lost his job and we had to move to a smaller house, when I was eight, he would really light into me. He would boost himself up by humiliating me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His father was threatened by Brian&rsquo;s success at school. He was afraid that Brian would surpass him, so he punished Brian for succeeding. His father undermined his self-confidence and damaged Brian&rsquo;s ability to believe in himself.</p>
<p>The Failure lifetrap feeds on itself in such a way that the entire arena of work becomes a disaster for you. Your expectation of failure becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy. Here are many of the ways you sabotage yourself and make sure that you remain a failure.</p>
<p><strong>Failure Lifetraps</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>You do not take the steps necessary to develop solid skills in your career (e.g., finish schooling, read latest developments, apprentice to an expert). You coast or try to fool people.</li>
<li>You choose a career below your potential (e.g., you finished college and have excellent mathematical ability, but are currently driving a taxicab).</li>
<li>You avoid taking the steps necessary to get promotions in your chosen career; your advancement has been unnecessarily halted (e.g., you fail to accept promotions or to ask for them; you do not promote yourself or make your abilities widely known to the people who count; you stay in a safe, dead-end job).</li>
<li>You do not want to tolerate working for other people, or working at entry-level jobs, so you end up on the periphery of your field, failing to work your way up the ladder. (Note the overlap with Entitlement and Subjugation.)</li>
<li>You take jobs but repeatedly get fired because of lateness, procrastination, poor job performance, bad attitude, etc.</li>
<li>You cannot commit to one career, so you float from job to job, never developing expertise in one area. You are a generalist in a job world that rewards specialists. You therefore never progress very far in any one career.</li>
<li>You selected a career in which it is extraordinarily hard to succeed, and you do not know when to give up (e.g., acting, professional sports, music).</li>
<li>You have been afraid to take initiative or make decisions independently at work, so you were never promoted to more responsible positions.</li>
<li>You feel that you are basically stupid or untalented, and therefore feel fraudulent, even though objectively you have been quite successful.</li>
<li>You minimize your abilities and accomplishments, and exaggerate your weaknesses and mistakes. You end wp feeling like a failure, even though you have been as successful as your peers.</li>
<li>You have chosen successful men/women as partners in relationships. You live vicariously through their success while not accomplishing much yourself.</li>
<li>You try to compensate for your lack of achievement or work skills by focusing on other assets (e.g., your looks, charm, youthfulness, sacrificing for others). But underneath you still feel like a failure.</li>
</ol>
<p>Many of these patterns boil down to the issue of Escape: you avoid taking the steps necessary to advance yourself. Through your avoidance, you constantly twist events to reinforce your view of yourself as stupid, untalented, and incompetent.</p>
<p>Excelling in other roles is a way of compensating for the lifetrap. Men might excel in sports or seducing women; women might excel in their looks or ability to give to others. But, particularly for men, it is hard to develop an effective compensation. What does society value more in a man  than achievement? A man who feels like a failure in his career is likely to feel like a failure as a person. Of course, this difference between men and women is changing as careers become more central to women&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>As a teenager Brian compensated for his lifetrap by adopting the image of a rebel. He dressed outlandishly and rode motorcycles. He became skilled at chasing women. He found a way to feel good about himself without tackling the prime issue. He compensated for his feelings of failure by carving out an area of success.</p>
<p>One way Kathleen compensates is by choosing a partner who is successful. Wayne, her husband, is the head writer on a top-rated television show. When she goes to job functions, such as cocktail parties and conventions, she moves in the highest circles.</p>
<p>You may be drawn to other roles or to partners who are successful to compensate for your feelings of failure. This is really another avoidance strategy on your part. It is another way for you to escape facing the challenges of achievement.</p>
<p>These compensations are fragile. They easily collapse, and yield to the feeling of failure. You need to deal with the issue of achievement more
directly.</p>
<p>These are the steps to changing your lifetrap:</p>
<p><em>Changing Your Failure Lifetrap</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Assess whether your feeling of failure is accurate or distorted.</li>
<li>Get in touch with the child inside of you who felt, and still feels, like a failure.</li>
<li>Help your inner child see that you were treated unfairly.</li>
<li>Become aware of your talents, skills, abilities, and accomplishments in the area of achievement. If you have, in fact, failed relative to your peers:</li>
<li>Try to see the pattern in your failures.</li>
<li>Once you see your pattern, make a plan to change it.</li>
<li>Make a flashcard to overcome your blueprint for failure. Follow your plan, step-by-step.</li>
<li>Involve your loved ones in the process.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s discuss the above points one by one in details:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Assess Whether Your Feeling of Failure Is Accurate or Distorted.</em> The first thing to do is assess the accuracy of your feeling of failure. As we have noted, most of the time, like Kathleen, you will have a lot of realistic evidence. You have in fact failed relative to your peers. But sometimes, like Brian, your perception of failure is inaccurate, and you will find little evidence to support your view.</li>
</ol>
<p>List a range of people with whom you went to high school, college, or graduate school. Be sure to choose people from the bottom, middle, and top of your class. Write down what each person has accomplished within their chosen fields. How far have they progressed? How much are they paid? How much responsibility do they have at work? Where do you stand in comparison?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><em>Get in Touch with the Child Inside of You Who Felt, and Still Feels, Like a Failure.</em> Try to recall memories of being criticized, humiliated, compared, or discouraged by your family or peers. Understand the origins of your lifetrap. <br>
When something happens in your current life to trigger your Failure lifetrap, take some time to explore the event through imagery. Sit in a dark,
quiet room and close your eyes. Get an image of the current event. Make the image as vivid and emotional as possible. Then let an image come of
when you felt the same way as a child. Do not force the image. Just let it float to the top of your mind. Here is an example from a session with Kathleen.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>KATHLEEN: <em>Oh, I really messed up. I feel so bad. I can&rsquo;t believe it. I told my boss the wrong time the moving men were coming with the set pieces. He hired all these guys to come in and work overtime to help move the stuff, and they all came at the wrong time. My boss had to pay them anyway. He was really mad at me. Oh my God, I feel so bad about it. I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about it. (Starts to cry.)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>Do you want to do imagery about this?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>KATHLEEN: <em>Okay. (Cries.)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>Then close your eyes and get an image of this situation that just happened with your boss.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>KATHLEEN: <em>All right. I see myself in my boss&rsquo;s office. He&rsquo;s about to come in to talk to me about what happened.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>How do you feel?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>KATHLEEN: <em>Oh, I feel frantic, really panic-stricken. I&rsquo;m pacing around, I don&rsquo;t know what to do with myself My heart is pounding. Oh, man. Vm
so scared.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THERAPIST: <em>Okay. Now give me another image of when you felt that way before, as a child.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>KATHLEEN: <em>All right. I&rsquo;m in my sixth-grade classroom. My teacher&rsquo;s there, and she&rsquo;s going around the room, and each person&rsquo;s presenting this
book report. We had all had to read part of this book on Africa the night before and make up a little presentation. Only of course I didn &rsquo;t do it. I didn&rsquo;t do it, and now she&rsquo;s going around the room and she&rsquo;s gonna come to me, and I&rsquo;m gonna have nothing to say.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your images can help you understand the origins of your lifetrap. That child who felt like a failure is still very much alive in you.</p>
<p>TODO</p>
<p><strong>SOME FINAL WORDS</strong></p>
<p>As we have noted, the Failure lifetrap is often connected to other lifetraps. To truly fight the Failure lifetrap, you will probably have to deal with these other issues as well. Brian had to work on his Defectiveness lifetrap, and Pamela had to work on her Emotional Deprivation. Read the chapters on any linked lifetraps. Work to overcome them as well.</p>
<p>The Failure lifetrap is one of the most rewarding to overcome. A whole area of life that is now fraught with shame and tension can become a source of self-esteem. But you have to be willing to fight. You have to be willing to close off your escapes and capitalize on your strengths.</p>

 When Margaret first walks into our office there is a frightened look in her eyes. It raises a protective impulse in us and we move to take care of her. When we tell her she seems frightened, she tells us that she does not even like to think about her problems, let alone talk about them.

  Do you feel that you are at your core somehow defective, that no one who truly knows you could possibly love and accept you?

 Jed: Thirty-nine years old. Women always disappoint him emotionally.
 Two things struck us about Jed as he walked into our office for the first time. One was how handsome he looked, and the other was how cold. There was a remote quality to him that was difficult to pierce in therapy. But in that first session he sat down and told us why he was there.

 Alison looks frightened when she walks into our office. It is obvious she is uncomfortable talking about herself. We try to put her at ease. After a while, we ask her why she has come. She tells us she is depressed.

      <description>Margaret: Twenty-eight years old, feels trapped in her marriage to an abusive husband.
 When Margaret first walks into our office there is a frightened look in her eyes. It raises a protective impulse in us and we move to take care of her. When we tell her she seems frightened, she tells us that she does not even like to think about her problems, let alone talk about them.</description>

  Do you feel that you are at your core somehow defective, that no one who truly knows you could possibly love and accept you?
  Do you put the needs of others above your own, so your needs never get metâ€”and so you do not even know what your real needs are?</description>

      <description>Margaret: Twenty-eight years old, feels trapped in her marriage to an abusive husband.
 When Margaret first walks into our office there is a frightened look in her eyes. It raises a protective impulse in us and we move to take care of her. When we tell her she seems frightened, she tells us that she does not even like to think about her problems, let alone talk about them.</description>

      <description>Are you repeatedly drawn into relationships with people who are cold to you? Do you feel that even the people closest to you do not care or understand enough about you?
  Do you feel that you are at your core somehow defective, that no one who truly knows you could possibly love and accept you?
  Do you put the needs of others above your own, so your needs never get metâ€”and so you do not even know what your real needs are?</description>

 Jed: Thirty-nine years old. Women always disappoint him emotionally.
 Two things struck us about Jed as he walked into our office for the first time. One was how handsome he looked, and the other was how cold. There was a remote quality to him that was difficult to pierce in therapy. But in that first session he sat down and told us why he was there.</description>

Why another self-help book?
We believe that Reinventing Your Life fills an important gap in the books currently available for self-improvement. There are many excellent self-help books, just as there are many fine therapy approaches. However, most of these are limited. Some books only deal with one specific problem, like codependency, depression, lack of assertiveness, or making poor partner choices. Some deal with many problems, but only use one means of change, like inner-child work, couples exercises, or cognitive-behavioral methods.</description>
